Birds are found on steep slopes lacking snow cover and gorges and crags with patches of snow and some herb and grass cover (McGowan 1994). Birds prefer south-facing slopes in summer and north-facing ones in winter. During winter they avoid areas with a covering of snow and use open ground with steppe-like vegetation instead (Tucker and Heath 1994). Courtship usually begins in April, with laying in late April and May. Typically five to nine eggs are laid (McGowan 1994). Nests are found on steep slopes in the open, beneath overhanging rocks, amongst stones or in tufts of grass (Tucker and Heath 1994). Birds feed exclusively on plant material, particularly legumes, feeding on bulbs, flowers, fruit and seeds (Baziev 1978). The species is mainly sedentary and in some areas does not even descend to lower altitudes during heavy snowfall. However some altitudinal movement has been observed in Turkey (McGowan 1994).","Its alpine habitat is threatened by overgrazing, which is easily reached by shepherds with guns, and with their sheep and dogs.

Generally they prefer open, mountain habitats with grassy patches, low scrub or scattered conifers (Griffin 2011). Winter flocks begin to break up from February and territories are established March to April with eggs laid from mid-May to June in the Alps and late-April to June in Greece. It is normally monogamous, forming long-term pair-bonds although some instances of successive bigamy and some exchange of partners have been reported. The nest site, believed to be chosen by the male, is a scrape excavated by the female. Clutches are normally eight to fourteen eggs. It is predominantly vegetarian, eating seeds, fruits and green material, but also some terrestrial invertebrates. Chicks, and females in spring, consume relatively high proportions of invertebrates, mainly adult and larval insects. Foraging continues day-round in winter, but is concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon in summer. This species is sedentary however, altitudinal movements are reported in mountain breeding areas, initially moving higher immediately post-breeding, then lower as winter advances. Birds may remain at breeding altitude of 1,900–2,700 m in winter, if snowfall is not too heavy (McGowan and Kirwan 2014).","Studies in different parts of the species's range (summarised in Griffin 2011) indicate that it is affected by a wide variety of threats, including habitat loss and degradation (Bernard-Laurent and de Franceschi 1994), abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities (Budinski et al. 2010, Rippa et al. 2011), reduced connectivity between metapopulations (Cattadori et al. 2003), disturbance, poaching, unsustainable hunting, extreme climatic events (Bernard-Laurent and Leonard 2000), hybridisation with released captive-bred Chukar (Alectoris chukar) and Red-legged Partridge (Alectoris rufa) (Barilani et al. 2007, Randi 2008), and the transfer of pathogens and parasites from these species (Manios et al. 2002, Rosà et al. 2011).

It uses habitats with a wide variety of soils and land uses including dry hilly land with scattered bushes up to about 1,300 m (occasionally up to 2,000 m) in montane foothills, inhospitable dry terrain on lower mountain slopes and marginal cultivation, cropland, orchards or woodland (McGowan and Kirwan 2013). Over most of its range it is associated with arable farming, using low-intensity cropping with a mixture of cultivated, fallow and uncultivated ground (Tucker and Heath 1994). Laying dates vary between countries; April to early May in Portugal, late April to May in England and May to mid-June in France. The nest is a scrape in the ground lined with a few pieces of vegetation. Clutch sizes average 11.2–12.7 eggs. It feeds on seeds, leaves and roots with grasses and legumes particularly important in winter. It will also eat insects. The species is mostly sedentary but may descend to lower ground during the winter (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).","The disappearance of uncultivated land due to changes in agricultural practice has resulted in the loss of nesting cover and chick food. In pastoral areas, pastures have been agriculturally improved and areas of low, herb-rich scrub converted to grassland and further habitat loss has occurred through the loss of arable farming from open hill areas, if livestock are removed (leading to encroachment of tall scrub and forest) (Tucker and Heath 1994). Urbanization and agricultural expansion have also caused habitat fragmentation. In the Iberian Peninsula, hunting has led to steep declines; in Portugal over 60% of estimated potential population may be shot each year (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).

It avoids bare soils (McGowan et al. 2013), trees and scrub (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Aubrais et al. 1986), preferring areas with a dense herb layer less than 1 m tall. Egg-laying occurs from mid-May to August in northern Europe and late March to mid-June in southern Europe. Typically 8–13 eggs are laid. The nest consists of a scrape with grassy material added and is found in herbaceous vegetation or grasses. Birds feed mainly on the seeds of grasses, weeds and grain but will also eat ground-dwelling invertebrates. Birds are migratory, with most of the western Palearctic population wintering south of the Sahara mainly in the Sahel zone; however birds may winter as far north as the British Isles and Germany or around the Mediterranean (McGowan et al. 2013). Birds may also winter in north-west Africa and remain to breed in March-April before migrating into Europe where they breed once again (Guyomarc'h and Saint-Jalme 1986, Guyomarc'h 1992, Rodriguez-Teijeiro et al. 1992). Migration routes are thought to vary between individuals and years (McGowan et al. 2013).","Agricultural intensification has led to the loss of rough grass and uncultivated land and an increase in the use of herbicides and insecticides which have led to a reduction on the availability of weeds, seeds and insects (Tucker and Heath 1994). Hybridization with Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) is a serious danger in southern Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Chazara et al. 2010).  Other potential threats driving declines in Europe are hunting, long-term climactic fluctuations and drought in the sub-Saharan wintering grounds (Tucker and Heath 1994).",Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex II.  Hunting legislation in Europe is in place but is poorly enforced (Tucker and Heath 1994). A European Species Management Plan was published in 2009 (Perennou 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedThe introduction of wide-scale habitat conservation measures is needed. The maintenance and promotion of low-intensity farming methods and the avoidance of ploughing or cutting in the nesting period would benefit this species. Existing hunting legislation should be enforced and hunters and trappers made aware of the dangers of excessive mortality.  In addition the further release of C. japonica should be prevented (Tucker and Heath 1994). Adequate population monitoring to assess hunting pressure and population trends should be implemented and research to investigate population dynamics undertaken (Perennou 2009).,,

Birds in northern areas on Russian tundra are partially migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998), moving south within its range to forested areas, outside the breeding season (de Juana et al. 2013).","The European population is estimated at 1,010,000-2,150,000 pairs, which equates to 2,020,000-4,310,000 mature individuals.

It prefers low, moderately moist areas with low shrubs, mosses, grasses and herbs avoiding rocky or lichen-rich tundra and steep slopes. Males prefer territories in areas with vegetation lower than eye level and elevated sites such as rocks, trees or hummocks for displaying on. Laying mainly occurs in May and June, but slightly earlier in the U.K. in April and May. It normally lays eight to eleven eggs. The nest is a shallow scrape with a thin lining in thick vegetation which usually partially covers it. It feeds on buds and twigs of Salix and birch (Betula) in winter. From spring to autumn leaves and berries of Vaccinium and Empetrum are important parts of its diet. It is sedentary in Scotland and Scandinavia, only making short-range altitudinal movements (de Juana et al. 2013).","The species is hunted everywhere except the Baltic Countries and Belarus. In the Russian tundra annual bags estimated at c. 2,000,000 west of the Urals (de Juana et al. 2013). The species seems to withstand such a heavy pressure, however in combination with other pressures, such as reductions in habitat quality and extent it can have adverse effects (Madge and McGowan 2002). Important declines in Finland were attributed to excessive hunting. Range contractions in Europe have been attributed to climatic changes (de Juana et al. 2013). It is also vulnerable to collisions with high-tension powerlines and deer fences (Madge and McGowan 2002).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is protected in the Baltic countries and Belarus (Madge and McGowan 2002), elsewhere the setting of hunting seasons and bag limits is generally the only management activity. Monitoring does occur in parts of Europe; In Norway several populations are regularly monitored, whereas in other parts of Fennoscandia and Britain, only some populations are monitored. In Britain, intensive habitat management has increased the density of this species well above natural levels in some areas (Storch 2007). There have been many attempted introductions, although most of them failed, (e.g. scoticus in Germany and Belgium) (de Juana et al. 2013). Conservation Actions ProposedMonitoring of populations in areas with potentially high hunting pressures should be undertaken to ensure they are sustainable. Research into the impacts of hunting and habitat alteration on population dynamics should be undertaken. More understanding of its migration and dispersal behaviour and its ability to cope with climate warming in some of its range is needed (Storch 2007).",,

It is rarely found in areas of high shrubs or below the tree line. It is almost always above 2,000 m in the Alps and Pyrenees. During winter it lives in less snowy regions or uses windswept ridges and slopes due to its dependence on ground vegetation for food. Laying is generally in June, however birds in Scotland lay from late May and those in Spitsbergen from mid-June (de Juana 1994). It typically lays five to eight eggs but sometimes up to twelve (Madge and McGowan 2002). The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material and some feathers, usually in the open and sheltered by a large stone or shrub. In winter it takes food from the ground, mainly buds and twigs of species including Salix. In the Alps and other southern areas its main winter foods are berry bearing shrubs including Vaccinium and Empetrum. In spring and autumn it has a more varied diet taking leaves, flowers, berries and seeds of a wide range of plants. Most populations make limited movements, which are largely altitudinal and depend on local conditions and weather (de Juana 1994).","The species faces some pressures at a local scale, such as habitat degradation and over-hunting (Madge and McGowan 2002). It is particularly susceptible to over-harvesting in the spring. Most habitat loss occurs due to the development of tourist facilities such as ski facilities and collision with cables around ski stations can cause mortality. Human presence may cause disturbance and displace birds from their wintering habitat. It is though that, in Sweden, overgrazing from reindeer is causing declines (Storch 2007). A recent decrease detected in the Swiss Alps, of 30% in a decade, attributed to climatic change (de Juana 1994).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU. Birds Directive Annex I and II. In most of its range, the only management is the setting of hunting seasons and bag limits and in Europe it is only protected in a few countries. A small proportion of its range is covered by protective areas, although these are considered to only have a low role in species survival except in those countries at the edge of the range (e.g., Andorra, France, Spain). Most monitoring is limited to the local scale. In Germany a programme to limit human disturbance by ski-touring has been initiated and in Iceland research into the effects of hunting there is ongoing (Storch 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitoring of populations in areas with potentially high hunting pressures should be undertaken to ensure they are sustainable. Measures should be taken in mountain ranges with high tourism to minimise the spatial and temporal overlap between important habitats and recreational activities and their effectiveness monitored. Also, actions to minimize the numbers of generalist predators in these areas should be taken. Research into the impacts of hunting and habitat alteration on population dynamics should be undertaken. More understanding of its migration and dispersal behaviour and the survival of young birds over winter is needed (Storch 2007).",,

In some parts of its range it shows a preference for nesting on small grassy islands (Johnsgard 1978) in tundra lakes and rivers. High Arctic nesters may also breed widely dispersed over icy tundra, well-away from water (Kear 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species becomes predominantly coastal, inhabiting estuaries, sandy shores (Carboneras et al. 2014), tidal mudlflats (Madge and Burn 1988), coastal saltmarshes, and shallow muddy bays (Kear 2005). In recent years the species has taken to grazing on coastal cultivated grasslands (Madge and Burn 1988) and winter cereal fields (Scott and Rose 1996), but rarely occurs on freshwater wetlands except on passage. It arrives on the breeding grounds in early June where it may breed in small, loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988) or dispersed in single pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground. Although the species often nests close to water (Carboneras et al. 2014) typically within a few hundred metres of the tideline (Snow and Perrins 1998), high Arctic nesters may breed on icy tundra well away from water (Kear 2005). Clutch size is typically three to five eggs. The species is mainly herbivorous although it may take animal matter. In its breeding habitat the diet of the species generally consists of grasses, mosses, lichens and aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2014), although the young may also take insects and aquatic invertebrates (Johnsgard 1978). Breeding success is highly dependent on the lemming cycle. Effectively only once every three years (the lemming peak years) is breeding success relatively high. Outside of the breeding season the species predominantly takes marine algae, seaweeds and other aquatic plants linked with salt or brackish water (Carboneras et al. 2014). This species is fully migratory, the main routes of migration being along Arctic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998).","This species is threatened by hunting (Kear 2005) which has caused severe declines in the past, although hunting bans have allowed it to begin to recover (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is susceptible to disturbance from vehicles in the U.K. (Burton et al. 2002) (although it is relatively tolerant of human disturbance, e.g. walkers, compared to other species) (Vickery and Gill 1999, Burton et al. 2002). In its winter range the species may be persecuted by farmers as in recent years it has increasingly taken to grazing on cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields near the coast (Scott and Rose 1996). The species may also be threatened in the future by reductions in abundance of sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) and eelgrasses (Zostera) (Clausen et al. 2012). It can use alternative feeding sources as demonstrated following the collapse of eelgrasses in the Netherlands (1930-1940), but these need to be highly nutritious and diverse. It has been shown that nest success is dependent on fat reserves that have been acquired in the staging areas (Ebbinge & Spaans 1995). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) predation (Madsen et al. 1992), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Inbreeding depression has also been identified as a threat to current population growth (Harrison et al. 2011).",Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex II.

Mikityuk in litt. 1999). Small numbers also winter in Azerbaijan. The precise distribution in winter varies according to the severity of the weather from the Crimean peninsula to the Dobrudzha region of Bulgaria. In cold weather, small numbers are occasionally on the Aegean shore of Greece and Turkey (Cranswick et al. 2010); during prolonged mild periods, significant numbers may remain in Kalmykya, Stavropol and Rostov districts in Russia (S. Rozenfeld in litt. 2012). Migration is believed to follow a relatively narrow route south down the Ob to Kazakhstan and then east to the Black Sea. The known main staging areas include the Kumo-Manych depression in Russia and they are also regularly recorded in small numbers on passage in Hungary (e.g., Pigniczki 2008). There may be other, currently unknown, staging sites and knowledge of the migration route should therefore be considered incomplete. It is also possible that some wintering grounds remain undetected (perhaps in eastern Ukraine and southwest Russia), and use of these areas during mild weather may account for the variation in winter survey totals in recent years.","The minimum European population in winter is estimated at 10,800-81,600 individuals, which equates to 7,200-54,400 individuals mature individuals. There exists also a marginal breeding population in Europe estimated at 5-10 pairs, which equates to 10-20 mature individuals. The species occurs in the EU27 only in winter and the minimum population is estimated at 9,900-74,900 individuals, which equates to 6,600-49,900 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species breeds in northern Siberia to the east of the Urals and winters along the coast of the Black Sea (Tucker and Heath 1994). It winters in low arable land near lakes and reservoirs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) which they use to roost at night.  It arrives October to November and departs between March and early May. The species feeds on grasses, sedges and some aquatic plants, particularly in winter, as well green sprouts of cereals, grain and tubers.","Deliberate hunting of birds occurs in Russia (Rozenfeld 2009, 2011b). Following land privatization, and especially the residential and tourist development boom in winter roosting and feeding areas, the quality of roosting areas has decreased. In addition, the low profitability of agriculture has reduced the area under winter wheat cultivation which, together with conversion to other crops, has decreased the availability of food. Some key feeding sites have been lost in Bulgaria (S. Dereliev in litt. 1999). Hunting pressure on waterfowl as a whole is substantial in Bulgaria and Romania, including illegal shooting of Red-breasted Goose (Simeonov in litt. 2007). There are no effective hunting-free areas around roost sites in Bulgaria (hunting is only prohibited for 100 m around the lake edge and this rule is regularly ignored). However, conservation activities in the area of Shabla and Durankulak lakes reduced deliberate shooting of the species in 2010-2012 (N. Petkov in litt. 2012). Disturbance in the lakes used for roosts is also caused by poachers and fishermen (Dereliev 1997, D. Hulea in litt. 2006). Disturbance/chasing of feeding birds by hunters (because they associate with White-fronted Geese (Anser erythropus), a legal quarry species) is a significant limitation on foraging behaviour and prenuptial accumulation of fat reserves, which has a negative effect on survival during spring migration and breeding (N. Petkov in litt. 2007). Hunting by tourists in Ukraine poses an increasing threat (WWT TWSG News 10 1997) and birds are shot at staging grounds in Russia. Other threats in wintering areas include the use of rodenticides and displacement by windfarms. Windfarms have undergone a major expansion in the wintering areas since 2008. Many thousands of wind turbines have been proposed in Dobrudhza area both in Bulgaria and Romania, including large complexes adjacent to IBAs and SPAs. Data analysis from wintering grounds in Bulgaria suggest that the constructed windfarms are already having an impact, leading to displacement and shifting of the foraging areas (Petkov et al. 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix I and II. It is legally protected in key states (Hunter et al. 1999). It is listed in the (national and regional) Red Book of Russia and Red Book of Bulgaria. Principal wintering roost sites are protected (some qualifying as Ramsar sites), including the implementation of hunting regulations and hunting-free areas in Russia, although hunting occurs in many feeding areas. A management plan is being implemented for roosting lakes in Bulgaria (S. Dereliev in litt. 1999). Wintering sites in Bulgaria and Romania are monitored and research and public awareness projects are ongoing (S. Dereliev in litt. 1999; D. Hulea in litt. 1999; Hunter et al. 1999). An International Action Plan was published in 2010 (Cranswick et al. 2010). An International Species Working Group is active and a coordinator is in place. In 2010 an EU Life project began in Bulgaria, which aims to address many of the key threats operating on the wintering grounds. A study of geese distribution, movements and feeding preferences will enable a sensitivity map to be developed and goose-sensitive guidance provided to authorities to help guide development proposals. A payment for the species has been included in the national agri-environmental programme of Romania. In Bulgaria, an agri-environmental payment to farmers for seeding winter wheat in key wintering areas for geese was introduced in 2012. Spring-hunting of wildfowl was prohibited in south-west Russia in spring 2012. Since 2010, a joint Bulgarian-U.S. project has been initiated to consolidate research into the species's ecology and to promote its conservation via engagement with local stakeholders, including landowners and farmers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).Conservation Actions ProposedStudy migration patterns and determine species's non-breeding range using satellite telemetry. Expand monitoring and research programmes, especially in Ukraine and Romania to determine whether more birds are overwintering there. Implement a Strategy for Hunting and Waterbird Resource Management (Rozenfeld 2011b). Regulate hunting in key sites (particularly spring hunting in Russia). Monitor and reduce disturbance and illegal hunting. Identify and protect key staging areas. Prevent loss of roosting lakes to urbanization. Monitor changes in agriculture and propose measures (in EU agri-environmental measures) to ensure suitable foraging habitat is available. Promote beneficial agricultural policies and spatial crop rotation planning around roosting areas. Continue public awareness initiatives. Lobby for full designation of qualifying wetlands and feeding areas as Natura 2000 sites, ensure hunting is not allowed within them and ensure they are properly managed.",,

However it is less dependent upon large water bodies for resting and feeding than most other Anatidae, and often occurs a considerable distance from water during the breeding season (Scott and Rose 1996). In the non-breeding season this species prefers streams, slow-flowing rivers, freshwater pools, flooded grasslands, marshes and brackish or saline lakes in lowland regions and is also found on artificial reservoirs (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard, 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It avoids coastal waters and tall, dense vegetation or emergent and floating aquatic plants (Madge and Burn 1988). Breeding occurs in single pairs or loose groups and in Europe eggs are laid from mid-March. Clutches are normally eight or nine eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of tender green shoots and the seeds of terrestrial vegetation, agricultural grains such as millet and wheat, littoral crustaceans such as shrimps, aquatic and terrestrial insects (especially Locusts), aquatic molluscs, small fish, frogs, amphibian spawn and worms (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard, 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In Europe the species is chiefly sedentary or dispersive, undertaking local movements linked to the availability of suitable water (moving away from drought-affected areas or to temporary wetlands) (Tucker and Heath 1994, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","Hunting is a threat, especially in south-east Europe (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005, Popovkina 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (e.g. in Turkey) (Scott and Rose 1996). Other threats to western populations include the loss and degradation of inland wetlands through subterranean water extraction for irrigation (Popovkina 2006) (leading to decreasing water supplies for seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands), widespread drainage of shallow marshes and lakes (Scott and Rose 1996), salt extraction (Green et al. 2002, Popovkina 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), urban development, pollution, introduction of exotic fish and overgrazing (Green et al. 2002, Popovkina 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). At the Klingnau Dam in northern Switzerland the species has been known to hybridise with the South African Shelduck (Tadorna cana) from escaped captive populations, which could pose a threat to the integrity of both species (Owen et al. 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

It may also be found on permanent, shallow, slightly alkaline marshes (Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras et al. 2014), as well as on oxbow lakes, channels (Flint et al. 1984), reservoirs and gravel-pits (Kear 2005). After hatching, females move their broods to deeper marshes or to the edges of large impoundments, sometimes more than 1 mile away from the nesting sites (Johnsgard 1978). Breeding begins in April and May, with egg-laying generally from second half of April in northern and central Europe and during early May in Turkey (Carboneras et al. 2014).

Ideal wetland habitats for this species are those surrounded by sparse open forest, woodland and especially agricultural land (Kretchmar 1994, Kear 2005), in the boreal and subarctic zone (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005). It avoids tundra, densely forested and mountainous country, as well as fast flowing rivers and streams, but tolerates saline or alkaline steppe lakes and wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). In the non-breeding season this species shows a preference for coastal salt-marshes, freshwater, brackish and saline lagoons, flooded grasslands, estuaries, intertidal mudflats (Cramp and Simmons 1977), and other sheltered marine habitats (Kear 2005). The breeding season is from April to June, varying across its range according to latitude, with nests sometimes initiated in April in Scotland, but may not arrive on breeding grounds in northern Russia until the second half of May (Carboneras et al. 2014). The nests of this species are shallow depressions in the ground lined with vegetation, usually positioned not far from water and well concealed under overhanging vegetation, in grass tussocks, scrub (Kear 2005), and especially in heather (Jacobsen and Ugelvik 1998). Usually eight or nine eggs are laid (Carboneras et al. 2014).It is vegetarian and consumes the leaves, seeds, stems and root bulbs of pond weeds, fine grasses (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979), horsetails (Kretchmar 1994) and eelgrass, as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978). Animal material is taken rarely and usually incidentally along with vegetation or seeds (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979, Kear 2005).

Avian influenza virus (strain H5N1) is also a potential threat (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Jonassen and Handeland 2007), as is poisoning from the ingestion of lead shot pellets (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). This species is hunted for sport (e.g. in the U.K.) (Kear 2005, Carboneras et al. 2014), and although population numbers in an area decrease significantly after a period of shooting, there is no current evidence that such utilisation poses an immediate threat to the species (Vaananen 2001, Bregnballe et al. 2006).

It requires water less than 1 m deep for foraging (Snow and Perrins 1998) and shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitats commonly frequented include flooded swampy woodlands, seasonal floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998), wet grassy swamps and meadows, oxbow lakes (Flint et al. 1984), open waters with mudflats, banks or spits, irrigation networks, reservoirs, ornamental waters (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), canals and sewage farms (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species may also be found in saline habitats along the coast (Madge and Burn 1988) where water is shallow, fairly sheltered and within sight of land (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds between March and June although the exact timing varies with latitude (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998) or bowl of vegetation that can be situated in many different locations such as within vegetation on the ground, in natural tree cavities (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), under fallen dead wood, on tree stumps and even in abandoned nests of other species (Flint et al. 1984). Clutch size is generally nine to thirteen eggs. The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, feeding on seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants, as well as terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates such as insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms and occasionally amphibians and fish (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In temperate regions breeding populations of this species are sedentary or dispersive, often making local movements during severe weather (Scott and Rose 1996). Other populations are fully migratory (Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss from pollution (e.g. petroleum (Grishanov 2006) and pesticide pollution (Kwon et al. 2004)), wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reedbeds (Grishanov 2006). The species also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (e.g. in Spain (Mateo et al. 1999) and France (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002)). It is also susceptible to duck virus enteritis (DVE) (Friend 2006), avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (Rocke 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases (although it may be able to withstand sporadic losses due to its high reproductive potential) (Rocke 2006). The species is predated by American Mink (Neovison vison) (Opermanis et al. 2001). The species is hunted throughout its range (Kear 2005) mainly for sport (Evans and Day 2002, Bregnballe et al. 2006, Mondain-Monval et al. 2006, Sorrenti et al. 2006).

Studies have revealed some of the species's requirements. Extensive grazing of wetland grasslands (c. 0.5 cows per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of the species in Hungary (Baldi et al. 2005). Studies in Danish coastal wetlands found that the spatial restriction of shore-based shooting was more successful at maintaining waterfowl population sizes than was the temporal restriction of shooting, and therefore that wildfowl reserves should incorporate shooting-free refuges that include adjacent marshland in order to ensure high waterfowl species diversity (Bregnballe et al. 2004). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the U.K. resulted in an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes, which in turn led to an increased use of the habitat for brood rearing by the species (Giles 1994).

Suitable habitats include well-vegetated lakes and marshes and with muddy shores and substrates in open country (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), as well as oxbow lakes, channels and swamps (former U.S.S.R.) (Flint et al. 1984). It also frequents artificial waters bordered by lush grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as sewage farms, rice-fields (Kear 2005) and fish ponds (Musil 2006). In the winter it can be found on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988), coastal shorelines, fresh and brackish estuarine marshes (Johnsgard 1978), inland seas and brackish or saline inland waters (Snow and Perrins 1998), occasionally occurring (briefly) on marine waters during migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998).  It arrives on the breeding grounds from March where it breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups in the northern spring (chiefly from mid-April to June). The nest is a scrape or depression (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on the ground in tall grass, among hummocks, in the open (Flint et al. 1984) or (rarely) in bulrush marshes (Kear 2005). Normally between nine and eleven eggs are laid. Its diet consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects, molluscs, the seeds of emergent and aquatic plants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), planktonic crustaceans (Snow and Perrins 1998), annelids, amphibian spawn, tadpoles, spiders, fish and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982). This species is highly migratory although it may be present all year round in parts of Europe (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The species is threatened by habitat loss from drainage and changing farmland practices (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), is occasionally killed by collisions with power transmission lines (Malcolm 1982), and suffers from nest predation by American Mink (Neovison vison) (Opermanis et al. 2001, Nordstrom et al. 2002, Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003). It is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Forrester et al. 1980) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Camargue, France and Spain (Mateo et al. 1998, Mondain-Monval et al. 2002)). The species is a favoured quarry species throughout most of the world, but is rarely taken in large numbers (Kear 2005). It is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and the Po delta, Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006).

Wetland habitats include shallow freshwater marshes, small marshy lakes, slow-flowing rivers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and wet meadows (Madge and Burn 1988), especially favouring ponds with low, dense marginal vegetation and wetlands interspersed with brushy thickets or copses (Johnsgard 1978). During the winter it also frequents large inland lakes (Scott and Rose 1996), brackish coastal lagoons, brackish (Madge and Burn 1988) and saline marshes (Steele et al. 1997), shallow fresh or brackish estuaries (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998), tidal flats (Madge and Burn 1988) and river deltas (Scott and Rose 1996) with adjacent agricultural land and scattered impoundments (Johnsgard 1978).It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups from April to June (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a slight hollow on the ground amongst vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and can be close to or more than 1 km away from water (Kear 2005).

This species is strongly migratory throughout its northern range (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat loss on its breeding and wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). Reclamation of coastal areas for industrial development poses a threat in Europe (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds in Russia (Grishanov 2006). It suffers from over-exploitation in Europe (Kear 2005). The species is predated by feral cats (Felis catus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) on islands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), and is susceptible to avian botulism (Rocke 2006) and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.

It is a highly sociable and gregarious species, and regularly forms large congregations of several hundred on passage but whilst breeding can be found in single pairs or small groups (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Meadows are the favoured nesting areas of this species, with nests rarely located more than 150 m from water (usually within 20 m) (Cramp and Simmons 1977). The nest itself is a depression in the ground, typically situated under rushes or tall grasses (such as manna grass, Glyceria), but not generally under shrubs (Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Typically eight to eleven eggs laid (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). When breeding this species is omnivorous (Johnsgard 1978). In spring and summer its diet is dominated by animal matter: chiefly molluscs, aquatic insects and their larvae (waterbugs, caddisfly, water beetles, midges), crustaceans (ostracods and phyllopods especially), worms, leeches, young and spawn of frogs, and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Hockey et al. 2005). Seeds, roots, tubers, stems, leaves and buds of plants such as Hornwort Ceratophyllum, Naiad Najas, sedge, grass and other aquatic plants are also important at this time (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). During the non-breeding season the birds are mainly vegetarian (Treca 1981). This species is highly migratory, breeding widely across western Eurasia and wintering within the northern tropics. It migrates on a broad front, the autumn migration beginning in late July and peaking in August or early September (in Europe and Egypt). The spring migration begins in February, with birds beginning to arrive on breeding grounds from mid-March to early-May (Scott and Rose 1996).","The most significant threat encountered by this species on its breeding grounds in Europe is habitat deterioration through the drainage and reclamation of wetlands (Kear 2005), the increasing climatic aridity and subsequent lowering of the water table, and the transformation of wetlands to dammed reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996). Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows, increased human disturbance, lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005). The invasive species American Mink (Neovison vison) also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis et al. 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). This species is hunted in Denmark, but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe et al. 2006).",Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.Conservation Actions ProposedKey areas of breeding habitat for this species should be identified and protected.

It starts breeding between April and July (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and usually nests in dense reedbeds although in Spain it also uses clumps of saltmarsh vegetation (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is monogamous and will nest in single pairs or loose groups. The nest is a slight depression on the ground, lined with grass and down, normally close to water but occasionally over it (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Clutches range from 5-20 eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In Spain the mean clutch size was recorded to be 11.8 (Green 1998). Diet varies considerably between seasons and sites and additionally with age. Diptera are an important component of the diet, especially before and during the breeding season. Small seeds become increasingly important after the breeding season with faeces of post-breeding birds in Turkey composing of 95% dry weight Scirpus seeds (Green and Selva 2000, Green and Sánchez 2003, Fuentes et al. 2004). This species is dispersive and partially migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It shows variable, nomadic movements and is capable of dispersal in search of suitable habitat at any time of year as changing conditions require (Scott and Rose 1996). In winter it can be found at a number of sites around the Mediterranean basin where it does not normally breed (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","Over 50% of suitable habitat may have been destroyed during the 20th century. Wetland drainage for agriculture occurs across its range. Hydrological work has severely affected breeding sites in Turkey and Spain. Reed-cutting, reed-burning and grazing commonly reduce the amount of habitat for nesting. Pollution from agricultural, industrial and domestic sources is a threat at many sites. When breeding, it is vulnerable to shooting and egg collection. Further mortality results from birds caught in fishing nets and lead poisoning (Mateo et al. 2001, Svanberg et al. 2006). A lack of habitat following hot, dry summer months probably results in high juvenile and adult mortality post-breeding (Green 2000, 2007).

The nest is a low platform (Snow and Perrins 1998) of reeds, grass and leaves (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) placed on the ground or on an islet or hummock in thick vegetation close to water (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). Alternatively nests may be placed over water on floating mats of vegetation or in dense reedbeds along the shoreline (Johnsgard 1978). Clutches are usually 8-10 eggs. Although the species is omnivorous, plant material such as seeds, roots and vegetative parts of aquatic plants dominates its diet. Animal matter taken includes worms, molluscs, crustaceans, insects and larvae, amphibians and small fish. This species is chiefly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), although little is known about its migratory routes (Scott and Rose 1996). Adults undertake a wing moulting period on the breeding grounds between July and August (Robinson and Hughes 2006) and departure from the breeding grounds begins in mid- to late-August (N. Petkov in litt. 2008). The return migration to the breeding grounds begins in early March (Scott and Rose 1996).","The species is threatened by the degradation and destruction of well-vegetated shallow pools and other wetland habitats (Vinicombe 2000, Kear 2005, Robinson and Hughes 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (e.g. changes to the vegetation community, disruption of water regimes, siltation, and increased water turbidity (Robinson and Hughes 2006)) as a result of excessive drainage and water abstraction (Vinicombe 2000, Grishanov 2006, Robinson and Hughes 2006), peat extraction (Grishanov 2006), eutrophication (from inadequate sewage treatment and nutrient run-off (Robinson and Hughes 2006)), oil pollution (Grishanov 2006), dam and barrage construction, the building of infrastructure on flood-plains (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006) and river canalisation (Kear 2005). Changing land management practices such as reed cutting and burning during the breeding season (Petkov 2006), over-grazing (Robinson and Hughes 2006) decreased grazing and mowing of wet meadows (Grishanov 2006), and abandonment (causing succession to scrub) or intensification (causing reversion to open water) of extensively managed fishponds (Vinicombe 2000, Kear 2005, Petkov 2006, Robinson and Hughes 2006) also threatens the species. The introduction of non-native species has caused further habitat degradation. For example the stocking of lakes with and accidental introduction of Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) has resulted in reductions in macrophyte biomass and corresponding reductions in invertebrate biomass (Kear 2005, Robinson and Hughes 2006), and in Bulgaria an introduced shrub (Desert False Indigo (Amorpha fruticosa)) is changing the ecological character of wetlands (Robinson and Hughes 2006). Increased drought due to global climate change may pose a threat to the species in part of its range (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006). Disturbance by fishing boats and anglers alongside fringe vegetation could cause abandonment of the breeding sites or disrupt the timing of breeding (N. Petkov in litt. 2008). Hunting is another serious threat to the species (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Large numbers are shot on passage in the autumn (e.g. through the Volga delta) (Kear 2005, Balmaki and Barati 2006). Illegal and accidental hunting also persists in most European countries. Other lower-level threats include lead poisoning (from ingestion of discarded lead shot), fires in areas of reed thickets, peat bogs and woods (Grishanov 2006), entanglement and drowning in fishing nets (Robinson and Hughes 2006) and hybridisation with native species (e.g. Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) and Common Pochard (Aythya farina) in Switzerland (Leuzinger 2010)).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is fully protected in Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Moldova, Netherlands, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, and is protected from hunting in Austria, Belgium, Greece, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine. It is listed on Annex I of the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and on Appendices I and II of the Bonn Convention. The species has received little international conservation action, although a number of national initiatives have been developed recently, notably habitat management in Bulgaria and re-introduction schemes in Italy (Berezovikov and Samusev 1998). An International Single Species Action Plan has been adopted by the Bern Convention, CMS and AEWA, which lays out a framework for conservation action throughout the species's range (Robinson and Callaghan 2003). A restoration project for two key breeding sites on the Danube in Bulgaria is underway, funded by the World Bank (N. Petkov in litt. 2003).Conservation Actions ProposedPromote the full legal protection of the species and its habitat through national and international legislation; promote environmentally friendly management of fishponds in eastern Europe; promote adequate protection and management of key sites; promote conservation in the wider environment for the benefit of the species and its habitat; prevent mortality and disturbance caused by hunting; monitor the remaining population and develop census techniques; investigate productivity and mortality; investigate ecology and limiting factors; investigate the impact of C. idella on the species and its habitat; develop and implement education programmes for the conservation of A. nyroca and its habitats.",,

It is common on large, freshwater lakes, ponds, reservoirs, gravel-pits and quiet stretches of wide slow-flowing rivers during this season. During the winter the species frequents large freshwater lakes (Kear 2005), reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and sheltered coastal locations such as brackish inland seas (Kear 2005) brackish lagoons, tidal bays (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migratory populations arrive on their breeding grounds from late-April (Kear 2005) where they breed in single pairs or loose groups (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The nest is constructed of vegetation and is placed in water (Kear 2005) on floating mats or islets (Flint et al. 1984), or on the ground on islands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) in rush or grass tussocks (Snow and Perrins 1998), under bushes or in the open amidst marsh-nesting gull or tern colonies (Kear 2005).

It also suffers decreased reproductive success as a result of disturbance from increased recreational use of inland waterbodies (Kear 2005), machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000), hunting (Evans and Day 2002) and predation by American Mink (Neovison vison) on islands (Nordstrom et al. 2002).

Experimental removal of the nest predator American Mink (Neovison vison) in the outer archipelago of south-west Finland resulted in an increase in the breeding density of this species (Nordstrom et al. 2002). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the U.K. resulted in an increase in invertebrate food availability and increases in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes, which in turn led to an increase in brood use of the habitat by the species and increased species survival (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).Conservation Actions ProposedLarge scale conservation measures should look to protect key breeding sites from habitat alteration and look to promote low-intensity farming.

It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving. The species winters on shallow coastal waters (Kear 2005) less than 10 m deep (Scott and Rose 1996) as well as sheltered bays, estuaries and brackish coastal lagoons. It is also found inland on large lakes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and reservoirs during this season (Madge and Burn 1988). It breeds in the high Arctic from late-May or early-June (depending on the timing of the Arctic thaw) (Kear 2005) in single pairs or loose groups (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), often with colonies of nesting gulls or terns (Kear 2005) although it is not itself a colonial species (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground close to water, either in thick vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978). Clutch size is normally 8–11 eggs. The species is omnivorous. Its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs but also includes laver shells (Hydrobia), insects, aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans, worms, small fish, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges and water weeds. This species is fully migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996), with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988).","The species is susceptible to oil pollution (Kirby et al. 1993, Kear 2005) when moulting and in winter and may be threatened by high levels of organochloride contaminants (Kear 2005). Its habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in the winter also puts it at risk from other pollution types (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Oil and gas exploration have caused habitat loss in European Russia and losses of feeding opportunities in some wintering areas through the over-harvesting of mussels and cockles, eutrophication and offshore windfarms are also considered possible threats. (Jensen 2009). Large numbers often drown due to entanglement in fishing nets (Kirby et al. 1993). It is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted legally for sport in seven countries of the European Union (Kear 2005) (e.g. Denmark [Bregnballe et al. 2006]) and suffers from disturbance from hunting (Evans and Day 2002).

It shows a preference for boulder-strewn or grassy islands (Johnsgard 1978) with sheltered approaches (Snow and Perrins 1998) that are safe from nest predators, although in the high Arctic where such shelter is unavailable more open sites must be used (in which case the species often nests in closely packed groups for protection) (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species typically winters on shallow seashores, bays and estuaries (Carboneras et al. 2014), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006). The species breeds from early-April (although the most northerly populations may not breed until mid-June (Madge and Burn 1988)), and generally nests in colonies. The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open. Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs although crustaceans, echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken. During the breeding season incubating females frequently complement their diet with algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (Carboneras et al. 2014).

It also comes into conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry which depletes the species's food resources (Kear 2005, Ens 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006,) and has previously lead to mass starvation events due to the over-fishing of benthic molluscs (e.g. in the Dutch Wadden Sea) (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006). On the breeding grounds, disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and from local shore-based activities (e.g. angling, dog-walking (Keller 1991) and scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003)) increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species on its wintering grounds (Nikolaeva et al. 2006).

Eiders breeding in Russia are subject to human subsistence harvesting and exposure to lead shot. Males are subject to particular hunting pressure as they arrive on the moulting grounds before females (Morse 2009). Increasing human habitation of Arctic regions has increased the range and numbers of ravens (Corvus corax) and some large gulls, leading to a greater risk of predation (Kear 2005). Recent dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness north of Alaska and Russia may affect eiders in unknown ways (Kear 2005). In addition, climate change is causing the loss of Arctic tundra ponds (Andresen  and Lougheed 2015), which could be contributing to declines in this species. Habitat loss also occurs through prospecting for, and the exploitation of, natural resources such as oil and gas (Kear 2005). The increasing traffic of tankers carrying oil from Arctic areas imposes the risk of contamination following spills (Kear 2005).

It generally avoids wooded tundra, although in north Scandinavia it does reach the arctic-alpine zone among willows and dwarf birch. It winters mostly at sea, generally far offshore, but also inland in large, deep, freshwater lakes or brackish lagoons (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).It breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in single pairs or loose groups (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The nest is a natural depression, or rock crevice, lined with surrounding plant matter and down, among vegetation or in the open and frequently close to water. Clutches are normally six to nine eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species shows a preference for marine foods (Johnsgard 1978). Its diet consists predominantly of animal matter (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as crustaceans, molluscs, other marine invertebrates, fish, and in fresh water, insects and their larvae; also a little plant material. The species is migratory, moving in large flocks at night. Many birds winter at sea in the far northern regions, generally as far south as Britain, the Danube River and the Black Sea. Birds leave their breeding grounds in the first half of October and return mid-March (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss from petroleum pollution, wetland drainage and peat-extraction (Grishanov 2006). It is also threatened with direct mortality from oil pollution (Gorski et al. 1977, Kirby et al. 1993, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), drowning through entanglement in fishing nets (Kirby et al. 1993, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and from hunting on migration routes over certain regions of the Arctic (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species has previously suffered heavy losses from an outbreak of avian cholera (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. There is evidence that the species is experiencing low reproductive success on its Arctic breeding grounds. The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites shows that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (e.g. Hario et al. 2009, Ellermaa et al. 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality. The breeding success of this (and other) species seems to have declined since the mid-1990s, when the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle in the abundance of Arctic rodents collapsed, probably due to climate change. With fewer rodents around, Arctic predators now take a heavier toll on breeding birds every year, instead of only once every 3-4 years. However, the main reason for low breeding productivity seems likely to be connected mainly with skipped breeding, rather than with increased predation pressure, possibly owing to worsened female body condition (A. Kondratyev in litt. 2012). A decline in breeding productivity is supported by unpublished data on the age ratio of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic, which suggest a decline in breeding success by c.75% from prior to 1990 until c. 2000 (J. Bellebaum in litt. 2012). Drastic declines on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 are thought to be connected to the natural cycles of the species, pollution from oil and gas extractions, and pollution from the deposition of nuclear and chemical waste in northern seas (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). In 2006-2007, on the Hatpudirskaya Bay coast (Barents Sea), several thousand dead C. hyemalis were found washed-up on beaches (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). The species is hunted for sport in several countries including Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006).",Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex II.

When breeding the species shows a preference for oligotrophic lakes devoid of fish (Kear 2005) but with abundant invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978), and requires tree-holes (or artificial nestboxes) for nesting. Suitable habitats include freshwater lakes, pools, rivers (Carboneras et al. 2014) and deep marshes (Johnsgard 1978) surrounded by coniferous forest (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species winters mainly at sea (Scott and Rose 1996) on inshore waters, estuaries, coastal lagoons (Carboneras et al. 2014) and shallow bays (Kear 2005), especially in the vicinity of sewage outfalls (Carboneras et al. 2014). Further to the south and on migration the species may also frequent large rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996). The species breeds from April in solitary pairs. The species nests in hollows of mature trees (Carboneras et al. 2014) formed by woodpeckers or by bacterial or fungal heart-rot invasions (Kear 2005). The species will also nest in artificial nest boxes Clutches are usually between eight and eleven. It feeds predominantly on aquatic invertebrates such as molluscs, worms, crustaceans, aquatic insects and insect larvae, as well as amphibians, small fish and some plant material (mainly in the autumn) such as seeds, roots and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2014). Most of this species is fully migratory although it may only travel short distances (Kear 2005), but certain populations in the north-west of Europe may also be sedentary (Carboneras et al. 2014).","The species is very sensitive to habitat alterations. In the winter, the main threats for this species are from major oil incidents near the coast or from eating contaminated food (organochlorines and polychlorinated biphenyls are elevated in some important wintering areas), as large flocks will often gather to feed around sewer outfalls. The species is hunted sustainably in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006); however the impact of hunting of this species across its range is unknown, although an estimated 100,000–250,000 were once shot annually in north-west and central Europe. Lead shot ingestion however, does not appear to be a significant risk, at least compared to some other species of seaducks (Carboneras et al. 2014). Modern forestry management work is limiting as it does not favour the retention of old and decaying trees with likely nest holes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex II. In some areas nestbox erection programmes have been shown to cause significant range expansions and population increases (Dennis 1987, Carboneras et al. 2014), although an experiment in southern Finland found that even though nestbox provision increased breeding numbers of the species there was a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive output (i.e. the number of fledged young did not increase despite an increase in breeding pairs) (Poysa and Poysa 2002).Conservation Actions ProposedIn general nesting habitats may benefit from a more extended rotation of timber harvesting (Kear 2005) and the species may benefit from the introduction of strict legislation on oil transportation.

During the winter and in early spring however the species mainly feeds on fish. This species is highly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","Where it occurs in large numbers on coastal waters the species is particularly vulnerable to oil pollution (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Populations declined in Europe throughout the 19th and 20th centuries due to habitat degradation and loss (e.g. the loss of mature trees in river valleys as a result of logging, conversion to agriculture and river canalisation). The species has also suffered local declines as a result of predation by American mink (Neovison vison) (Kear 2005) and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).

Breeding occurs in a variety of forest-types, from dry pine (Pinus) stands to riparian forest. Dense forest blocks are avoided, the birds tending to settle along south-facing forest edges, or in clear-felled or burned patches. Where summers are relatively cold or humid, localities with dry sandy soil are preferred (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is territorial and partners display by head-swinging with ruffled head feathers. Laying occurs from May to June. The nest-site is selected by both sexes and is usually in a natural cavity, an old hole of another woodpecker, or an artificial nestbox. Typically seven to twelve eggs are laid (Winkler and Christie 2002). It feeds mostly on the larvae and pupae of ants. In northern areas or during bad weather insects, spiders, even tadpoles and berries may be fed to young (Tucker and Heath 1994). Across most of its range, it is fully migratory and winters mainly in south of the Sahara and occasionally in the Mediterranean basin (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Declines have been attributed to climatic changes, resulting in increased rainfall during the breeding season (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Winkler and Christie 2002). Since the 1950s, the loss of important habitats such as orchards and unimproved meadows and the replacement of hardwoods with conifers have also caused declines and the conversion of many areas to agriculture combined with an increase in the use of pesticides have also decreased the abundance of ants (Tucker and Heath 1994).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II. It is listed as a priority species in the U.K. Biodiversity Action Plan.Conservation Actions ProposedThe use of pesticides should be reduced in agricultural areas and orchards and low-intensity management techniques applied to meadows, pastures and orchards in order to help sustain ant populations. These habitats should also be preserved from conversion to intensively managed open fields or commercial forestry plantations. In addition suitable nest-sites in woods and along forest edges should be protected and where nest-sites are limiting, nest boxes should be erected (Tucker and Heath 1994).",,

The nest is usually a hole in a tree or occasionally in walls, ruins, on the ground and in the old nests of magpies or other corvids. No material is added and typically four eggs are laid (Mikkola 1983). It feeds mostly on insects and other invertebrates and some small birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals (Holt et al. 1999). Northernmost populations are fully migratory, wintering from the Mediterranean to the Equator but most southern populations are partially migratory or sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Declines in this species are most likely down to habitat changes and a reduction in insect populations (Holt et al. 1999), probably from the use of pesticides (König 2008). The spread of large-scale farming, modernisation of agricultural methods and the reduction in the number of hollow trees may have driven its extirpation from areas in France and Spain (Holt et al. 1999, König 2008). In Switzerland, suitable habitat has been fragmented by spread of viniculture and agricultural intensification (Holt et al. 1999).

The species is monogamous and breeds from February to August in Scandinavia, however egg-laying occurs in December in France. It nests on sheltered cliff ledges or in crevices, in a cave entrance, on the ground on steep slope or on flatter ground in taiga. Occasionally it uses old tree nests of other species and rarely in hole in tree. The same site is often used for several years or in rotation with other favoured sites.

In northern Europe it prefers deciduous or mixed forests to coniferous forest and spare, young stands to older denser ones. In southern European mountains such as the Alps it mainly uses moderately dense forest of spruce and fir, or larch (de Juana and Boesman 2013). It uses logged clearings in boreal forest, but such successional stages are ephemeral, necessitating local shifts in distribution. In western and central Europe the species uses heathland and meadows and in the central European mountains it uses areas around the treeline (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also known to use bogs and areas of marginal cultivation. It lays between May and June. Laying an average of eight eggs (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Males form leks at traditional sites (Tucker and Heath 1994). The nest is a shallow scrape usually lined with some plant material and feathers. In many places it feeds on birch catkins and buds, shoots, needles, cones and male flowers of conifers in winter. In areas with less snow cover it uses more shrubs and grasses. In spring it switches to berries, stems and shoots of shrubs. It is largely sedentary although eruptive in some northern areas, with flocks moving hundreds of kilometres (de Juana and Boesman 2013).","In western and central Europe, habitat fragmentation and destruction are serious threats (Tucker and Heath 1994), which occur mostly through increased cultivation, afforestation of heathlands, removal of birch stands and the planting of coniferous monocultures (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Intensive grazing of sheep is replacing traditional grazing that normally helped maintain suitable habitat, leading to the destruction of birch (Betula) scrub and heather moorland. In central Europe, heathland is being transformed into grassland by eutrophication through airborne nitrogen deposition (Tucker and Heath 1994). Related to these large-scale land use changes, predation by mammalian and avian predators appears to have increased. (Storch 2007). On a local scale, other threats include hunting and disturbance at leks. In the Italian alps, stress hormone levels have been shown to be increased by disturbance from snow sport, which may reduce resistance to disease (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Collisions with high-tension powerlines may kill many birds in Scandinavia and in Scotland, collisions with deer fences may be a problem. It is also though long-term climate trends may partly explain recent declines (Storch 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I, II and III. In general the species is fully and effectively protected in western and central Europe. In other countries (e.g., Austria, Italy and France) hunting is strictly regulated. Only a small proportion of the species range falls within protected areas, most of which are likely too small to sustain a viable population, however locally reserves are seen as essential for the conservation of this species. In areas where it is hunted, regular monitoring occurs to plan harvests and in areas with small remnant populations. In some countries, such as Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, campaigns to limit disturbance have been initiated. These generally use public awareness campaigns, re-routing of hiking and skiing trails and the closure of core areas to the public. The release of captive bred birds to supplement wild populations has been attempted several times with little success (Storch 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedThe preservation and restoration of suitable habitat through habitat management is needed. The integration of land-use practices and conservation measures is essential. In addition maintaining and restoring spatial connectivity between populations is required. In areas where illegal hunting occurs, better law enforcement is needed. Monitoring should be continued and undertaken in areas where the species is endangered in order to establish population trends and effectiveness of management plans (Storch 2007). Further research is require (Tucker and Heath 1994, Storch 2007) and should investigate the impacts of hunting, habitat fragmentation and patch isolation, dispersal rates and distances, large-scale habitat relationships and population dynamics.

Welch in litt. 2005, Isfendiyaroglu et al. 2007). Construction of summer homes and wood-cutting for fuel reduces the availability of winter foraging habitat. Habitat loss and deterioration are also likely to be major threats with 40% of subalpine meadows within its range suffering from intensive grazing (WWF/IUCN 1994). The density of birds in grazed areas is low. Grazing livestock disturb and trample nests and birds are killed by herders' dogs (S. Klaus in litt. 2007). Illegal hunting is an increasing threat, particularly in the Lesser Caucasus and in Turkey, both by local residents and occasionally by tourists (E. Ménoni in litt. 2007). Dam building and subsequent re-settlement of displaced people is likely to cause significant declines in Turkey (Baskaya 2003).","Conservation Actions UnderwayLarge-scale research and conservation projects are underway in Georgia and Turkey to improve understanding of the species' biology, develop monitoring and management activities and promote public awareness, and a project to survey the species in Azerbaijan has been carried out (IUCN/SSC/BirdLife/WPA Grouse Specialist Group 2002, Azniashvili 2004, R. Gokhelashvili in litt. 2005, E. Sultanov in litt. 2005, Sultanov 2006). Future work to develop a conservation strategy and create a potential distribution map for all range countries is planned. A captive breeding program is being developed in Armenia.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue research into its population status, ecological requirements and interactions with different farming and forestry methods. Encourage the development and implementation of national Species Action Plans. Develop a framework for grouse-friendly farming practice, including control of dogs and regulation of hunting. Develop public awareness campaigns. Prevent road construction and inappropriate development in key areas for the species. Review the adequacy of the existing protected area network. Monitor populations at a number of sites throughout its range, especially close to sites which are being developed.",,

For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","The species inhabits forest and woodland, mainly coniferous or mixed coniferous deciduous (de Juana and Kirwan 2012). It prefers extensive areas of old, shady forest often with damp soil and interspersed with bogs, areas of peat or glades, and with a dense undergrowth of ericaceous plants (Vaccinium, Calluna) but with canopy neither too open or closed (Madge and McGowan 2002). It may use more open forest in winter and denser forest with abundant fruit bushes in summer. Males form ill-defined leks (de Juana and Kirwan 2012). It lays from mid-April to mid-June but with most laying in May. It lays six to nine eggs (Madge and McGowan 2002). The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material or feathers and it is found in thick cover often at the base of a tree (Harrison and Castell 2002). In northern parts of its range it feeds predominantly on pine needles during the winter. In southern parts of the range its winter diet is more varied. In summer its diet includes needles, leaves, stems and berries of a variety of plants. Insects are only important in the diet of small chicks. It is mainly sedentary with local movements in winter in response to feeding requirements (de Juana and Kirwan 2012).","The main threat to this species is destruction or alteration of its woodland habitat. It is still commonly heavily hunted (even during breeding season), except in SW and C Europe. Other factors possibly involved in declines include disturbance (e.g. development of ski facilities and other winter recreation activities), collisions (especially of juveniles) with high-tension powerlines and in some areas fences, predation (e.g. by foxes), pollution (acid rain) and climatic changes, (e.g. in Scotland) (de Juana and Kirwan 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayIn general the species is fully and effectively protected in western and central Europe. In countries such as Austria, Italy and France, hunting is allowed in certain areas and strictly regulated, however in eastern and southern Europe illegal hunting may be having a serious impact on the population. A small proportion of the species range is covered by protected areas, however these are only important where populations are particularly threatened by habitat degradation and poaching. In central and western Europe, the Natura 2000 network cover large parts of the capercaillie's range. Surveys or monitoring occur regularly for planning harvests or in regions with small remnant populations. Habitat manangement is thought to be the most important conservation tool for this species and a good example is ongoing in Scotland within the EU life Programme. There have been many reintroduction attempt over the years, although most have failed (Storch 2007). In Scotland, it went extinct from 1785 but was successfully reintroduced in 1836–1837. However, countrywide numbers estimated at c. 1980 birds in winter 2003/04, and it is declining. Guidelines have been proposed in the U.K. for buffer zones around leks and breeding areas (de Juana and Kirwan 2013).Conservation Actions ProposedThe integration of forestry practices and capercaillie conservation is needed to help maintain the large areas of open forest which it needs and maintain and restore spatial connection among populations. In addition, all development should be banned where populations are threatened. Human disturbance should be reduced, particularly in areas with small or threatened populations. The reduction of collision mortality could be achieved through the removal, relocation and visualization by marking of power lines, cables and deer and sheep fences. Better law enforcement is needed locally in areas where it is threatened by poaching. Monitoring programmes and research on larger-scale habitat relationships, predation patterns and population dynamics, minimum requirements in population size and in habitat area and connections should be undertaken (Storch 2007).",,

It seems to avoid pure coniferous stands and occurs in areas without conifers (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). It generally prefers large, dense forests with rich, varied undergrowth (up to c. 2 m tall) and occasional clearings (Madge and McGowan 2002). Laying occurs in April and May in central Europe and May to June in Scandinavia (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). It lays seven to eleven eggs. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with plant material and well concealed by undergrowth or under roots of fallen trees (Madge and McGowan 2002). Its diet changes seasonally, feeding on catkins, buds and twigs of Alnus and Betula in winter; leaves, flowers and newly sprouted vegetation in spring (Swenson 1994); berries and fruits in summer and autumn; and nuts, acorns and seeds in autumn. Chicks feed almost exclusively on arthropods during the first ten days before becoming more vegetarian. The species is highly sedentary (de Juana and Kirwan 2013).","The species is hunted but it has secretive habits and it is unlikely to be significantly affected by this, although in the 1970s some annual bag totals reached c. 10,200 birds in Norway, c. 18,000 in Sweden and 28,000?69,600 in Finland. It is more intensively hunted in European Russia and Siberia where perhaps as many as two million birds taken per annum during early 1990s (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). It has very specific habitat structure requirements (Madge and McGowan 2002) and so is very sensitive to habitat changes, particularly modern forestry trends (Schäublin and Bollmann 2011, de Juana & Kirwan 2013). Although small-scale timber work could have positive effects, as could permitting natural reforestation of areas subject to natural events such as avalanches, insect calamities, fires and erosion. In countries where harvesting is important, e.g. Finland it is often easier promoting management practices that favour the species. The species has an enormous range, so protected areas play only a very limited role in its protection, although conservations units can be locally important in the preservation of subpopulations, e.g. in Greece, Hungary and Belgium) (de Juana and Kirwan 2013).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I and II. Reintroductions have been attempted in some areas such as west Germany (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). Hunting of this species is banned in several countries. A small proportion of its range is covered by protected areas and their role is generally considered limited, however they can be important in countries at the edge of its range (e.g. Greece, Hungary and Belgium). Monitoring is common in Fennoscandia for the purpose of harvest planning. Elsewhere monitoring and surveys are mostly regionally restricted and irregular. In some part of Europe habitat management, such as maintaining coppice woodlands, favouring deciduous trees and shrubs within coniferous forests and planting patches of conifers for cover within extensive deciduous forests does occur (Storch 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedForest practices should be integrated with habitat conservation and habitats for the species need to be considered at a landscape scale, maintaining and restoring spatial connectivity among populations. In countries on the edge of its range, protected areas may be effective in preventing declines as well. Monitoring of populations should be undertaken to ensure numbers are stable and exploitation is sustainable. Better law enforcement is needed in countries where it is threatened and illegal hunting is common (e.g. Bulgaria and Greece) (Storch 2007).",,

Within the EU27 the small population is fluctuating or stable and it is therefore listed as Vulnerable. ",Decreasing,"The species is resident in Spain and larger populations breed in Russia and Turkey. It occurs on passage and in winter in the eastern Mediterranean. Concurrently, breeding populations have become extinct in Italy, France, Hungary, Albania, former Yugoslavia and Greece, and probably also in the Ukraine and Armenia (Snow and Perrins 1998, Carboneras and Kirwan 2015).","The European population is estimated at 250-610 pairs, which equates to 500-1,200 mature individuals. The population in the EU27 is estimated at 120-320 pairs, which equates to 240-640 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species breeds in small, shallow, fresh to brackish wetlands with dense submerged vegetation and extensive reedbeds (Tucker and Heath 1994). Breeding begins in April with broods hatching mostly in June and July (Carboneras and Kirwan 2015). Nests are a platform of reed stems and leaves sparsely lined with down and are built in dense vegetation, on the ground or over water, often in old nests of other waterbirds. They are sometimes sited within gull and tern colonies, and birds will use specially constructed nest-boxes. Clutches are usually four to nine white eggs and females may re-lay if the first clutch is lost. As a diving duck, its diet consists of midge larvae and other aquatic invertebrates.  Seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants are also taken (Carboneras and Kirwan 2015). Most birds are migratory, wintering in Europe from further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. Breeding in Europe is mostly concentrated in Spain where the population is resident but also occurs in Russia and Turkey (Tucker and Heath 1994).","The greatest long-term threat to the species's survival is thought to be competition and introgressive hybridisation (i.e. genetic swamping) with the non-native North American Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) (Green and Hughes 1996, Green and Hughes 2001, Muñoz-Fuentes et al. 2007). Both male Ruddy Ducks and male hybrids are socially dominant over male White-headed Ducks during courtship (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996). The threat from the Ruddy Duck is extremely serious, given that, if allowed to proceed beyond a certain point, the Ruddy Duck's spread across the Palearctic will become unstoppable, especially if the species was allowed to become established in White-headed Duck range-states such as Turkey or the Russian Federation, where the huge size and area of the wetlands and their infrequent monitoring would make control impossible (Hughes et al. 2006). Approximately 50% of breeding habitat has been drained during the 20th century. Remaining sites are vulnerable to drainage, filling, pollution and disturbance. Water abstraction for agriculture and other uses has affected water levels in many important sites throughout the range. The genetic diversity of the western European population is low (Muñoz-Fuentez et al. 2005) owing to its having suffered a bottleneck in the 1970s and early 1980s when only a few dozen individuals remained in the wild (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996, Muñoz-Fuentez et al. 2005). This may lessen the adaptive potential of the population, rendering it less able to withstand environmental change (Muñoz-Fuentez et al. 2005). Further threats include drowning in fishing-nets, hunting and ingestion of lead shot (Green et al. 1996, J. Criado in litt. 1999, Mateo et al. 2001, A.A. Khan, A. Parveen, and R. Yasmeen in litt. 2005). The species is hunted illegally in most of the range states but this has not been quantified, apart from in Turkey. Hunting and egg collection are the most likely reason for extinction in some countries (Hughes et al. 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix I and II. The species is legally protected in many range countries and occurs in a number of protected areas. A conservation programme in Spain has resulted in a significant population increase (J. Criado in litt. 1999). Ruddy Ducks (O. jamaicensis) are controlled in 15 western Palearctic countries, including Spain, Portugal and France. A programme was started in 2005 to eradicate the U.K. population of Ruddy Ducks and by 2009, over 6,200 ducks had been culled, resulting in a suggested decrease in the U.K. population of almost 90% (Henderson 2009). Reintroduction schemes are operational in Majorca and Italy (B. Hughes in litt. 1999, A. J. Green in litt. 2012). A European action plan was published in 2006 (Hughes et al. 2006). Sport hunting has been banned on two primary wintering lakes (Burdur Gölü and Yarisli Gölü) in Turkey where hunting from speedboats was threatening the White-headed Duck (Green et al. 1996).Conservation Actions ProposedSurvey breeding and wintering grounds and migration sites. Enforce strict protection from hunting. Conduct comprehensive winter monitoring and tracking studies to improve knowledge of migration routes and phenology (Li and Mundkur 1993). Protect and manage key sites and their catchments, including monitoring of hydrology and water pollution (M.A. Tabur in litt. 2005). Reduce disturbance by fisheries.

It is also common on artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs, gravel-pits, ornamental lakes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), ditches (Snow and Perrins 1998) and canals (Scott and Rose 1996), and will graze on grassland and agricultural land (e.g. arable cereal fields) (Kear 2005). Moulting congregations of adults and non-breeders (Snow and Perrins 1998) may also utilise brackish or saline habitats (Johnsgard 1978) including brackish marshes (Kear 2005), estuaries and sheltered coastal sites (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and bays (Madge and Burn 1988).The species breeds during the local spring as isolated pairs in well-defended territories. The nest is a large mound of aquatic vegetation placed close to or floating on shallow water or amongst reeds (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). Breeding pairs often re-use nesting sites from previous years if it was successful (Johnsgard 1978). Usually five to seven eggs are laid at two-day intervals. Its diet consists predominantly of leaves and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants and grasses (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978) and grain, occasionally also taking small amphibians and aquatic invertebrates (e.g. molluscs, insects and worms). Truly wild populations of this species are migratory (particularly where displaced by cold weather) (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) although European and feral populations are essentially sedentary or only locally migratory or nomadic (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","The species suffers heavy losses from lead poisoning due to ingested lead fishing weights (Kelly and Kelly 2004), lead shot (Spray and Milne 1988) and lead-contaminated sediments from mining and smelting activities (Day et al. 2003). Heavy losses have also been recorded from local incidences of copper poisoning (Kobayashi et al. 1992). The ingestion of or entanglement in fishing lines and/or hooks can also cause severe injury or mortality (Kelly and Kelly 2004) as can collisions with overhead lines (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) although European and feral populations are essentially sedentary or only locally migratory). The species may be threatened by future oil spills (which can cause death by oil saturation) (Berglund et al. 1963). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (e.g. strain H5N1) (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Nagy et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus. Significant mortality can occur with prolonged freezing weather in winter which prevents birds from feeding (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II.

It rarely nests in shrub tundra, and generally avoids forested areas (Kear 2005). On migration the species frequents shallow ponds, lowland and upland lakes, reservoirs, riverine marshes, shallow saline lagoons and sheltered coastal bays and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005).

This species is fully migratory and travels on a narrow front via specific routes using well-known stop-over sites (Madge and Burn 1988) between its Arctic breeding and temperate wintering grounds (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).","The species is threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitats due to drainage (Kear 2005) (e.g. for agriculture (Grishanov 2006)), petroleum pollution, peat extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub overgrowth), the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006) and eutrophication (Kear 2005). The NW European population is thought to be particularly sensitive to land-use change as well as climate change due to its narrow breeding distribution across the Russian high Arctic and its high dependency on a small number of stop-over sites during spring and autumn migration (Nagy et al. 2012).  Its Arctic breeding habitat is also threatened by oil and gas exploration (Kear 2005). The species is threatened by mortality from oil pollution (oil spills) in moulting and pre-migrational staging areas, from collisions with powerlines and wind turbines, and from lead poisoning as a result of lead shot (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and fishing weight ingestion during migration and on wintering grounds (Kear 2005).

Natura 2000 network protects some of the key staging and wintering wetlands in the EU, but most feeding sites are on arable and grasslands outside of these sites. In all range countries it is protected from direct persecution by national law. In Estonia and Lithuania active site management programmes are in place for this species at key stop-over sites. Important wintering sites are managed in the U.K. (by the RSPB and WWT) and in the Netherlands. The EU's environmental and nature conservation financial instrument LIFE has co-financed several targeted demonstration and best practice projects in countries such as Finland, Latvia and the Netherlands, aimed at the conservation of coastal inlets and wetlands which are habitats used by the species. Monitoring of populations and breeding success in most countries within its European range and intensive research on its ecology has been carried out in the Netherlands and at various stop-over sites in recent decades (Nagy et al. 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedThe protected status of the species across the range of the population should be maintained. Key stop-over and wintering sites should be maintained and, if necessary, restored, ensuring suitable aquatic macrophyte availability through managing water levels and water quality. In addition, measures should be implemented to prevent the negative impacts of infrastructure and industrial development by avoiding key sites, or by mitigating any potential negative impacts in the absence of alternative locations. Where necessary, develop and implement emergency plans by companies involved in the exploitation and transportation of petrochemicals on the flyway to reduce mortality in case of accidents. Monitoring and research of population changes and demographic parameters should continue and dead bird surveillance should be expanded to cover the entire flyway of the species. Introduce compensatory payments and other site management measures and increase efforts to reduce illegal shooting (Nagy et al. 2012).",,

The species overwinters on extensive areas of saltmarsh (Kear 2005) in estuaries and on flat agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (e.g. improved or fertilised grasslands, stubble fields, pastures and newly sown cereal fields) (Kear 2005). In Scotland favoured winter daytime roosting sites include estuarine mudflats, lochs and reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988).It breeds from mid-May to late-June or early-July (Kear 2005) in territorial pairs which may form loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a low mound of vegetation on cliffs, rocky outcrops or snow-free hummocks (Kear 2005). Three to five eggs are usually laid. The species is herbivorous (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and an opportunistic forager (Kear 2005). During the breeding season its diet includes leaves, stems, roots, berries and seed-heads of sedges, mosses, lichens, and grasses. In its wintering areas the species is more reliant on grass, grain, vegetables and potatoes grown on agricultural land. This species is fully migratory travelling on a narrow front between separate breeding and wintering grounds (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The species is hunted illegally in the spring in Iceland which may become a threat. Disturbance from hunting on spring staging grounds in Norway has major negative impact on breeding success, and persecution (shooting and disturbance) of the species by farmers is likely to increase in the future if populations increase (due to the species's impact on agricultural grassland) (Kear 2005). The species is subject to hunting in Svalbard and Denmark as well as Norway, although mortality due to hunting does not seem to be a major factor controlling population sizes (O'Connell et al. 2006). Disturbance from farmers discouraging foraging individuals from their land in the winter has been shown to reduce the species's reproductive success in the spring (Madsen 1995), and the species is also threatened by general disturbance (e.g. from helicopters surveying areas for oil exploration) (Mosbech and Glahder 1991). It may be threatened by land-management changes (such as a reduction in the intensity of management and land abandonment) (Tombre et al. 2005), and by future habitat loss such as the development of hydroelectric projects on interior rivers in Iceland (which would flood a major moulting area) (Kear 2005). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus) predation (Madsen et al. 1992).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II. CMS Appendix II. In the Netherlands and the UK and some other areas in Europe, governments compensate farmers in relevant goose areas to further conservation. Recent population increases are most likely due to the protection of sites, changed behaviour (birds using inland roosting sites such as reservoirs), improved food supplies and a reduction of hunting. Although the species is considered legitimate quarry in all range states, special restrictions are in force throughout, for example in Denmark goose shooting is only permitted early mornings during a short autumn season and recreational hunting in spring is banned everywhere (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In 2012 an International Species Management Plan was developed for the Svalbard population (Madsen and Williams 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedCompensation schemes for farmers should be continued and improved. Research in Norway has suggested the current compensation scheme can be made ten times more efficient through strategic prioritization. Careful management in important areas is needed to maintain the current population. In the UK, one study suggested that the manipulation of sward height and fertiliser application provides suitable habitat for this and other species of geese (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Hunting should be monitored and sustainable hunting levels ensured where hunting is in practice. Spatial management should be enhanced and maintained (Madsen and Williams 2012).",,

Taiga nesting populations show a preference for scrubby birch (Betula spp.) forest and dense spruce forest with bogs or mires (Madge and Burn 1988), whereas tundra-based populations nest on damp tundra of moss, grass, sedge or scrub (Johnsgard 1978) near river flood-plains (but above flood levels) on Arctic islands and in Arctic coastal regions (Madge and Burn 1988). During the winter and on passage the species inhabits marshes, agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), damp steppe grassland (Madge and Burn 1988), flood-lands, rivers and coastal shallows (Snow and Perrins 1998) in open country. It also roosts on lakes, rivers and flood-lands in Europe during this season. Populations that breed in the taiga nest in early-May, with those breeding in the tundra nesting one month later in early-June (Kear 2005).

The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of herbs, grasses, sedges (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and mosses (Johnsgard 1978), complemented during the breeding season by berries. During the winter it feeds predominantly on agricultural land taking grain, beans, potatoes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and sprouting winter cereal crops (Kear 2005). This species is strongly migratory and travels between breeding grounds in the high Arctic to wintering grounds in the temperate and subtropical zones (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The species declined in the past due to hunting (resulting in mortality, injury and disturbance) (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva et al. 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and habitat loss (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Habitat degradation due to oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), drainage, peat-extraction, changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and forest clearance is a threat to breeding areas in Russia (Grishanov 2006), Norway and Sweden (Madge and Burn 1988). The species also suffers from human persecution (Madge and Burn 1988) and is susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004).

In many countries, counts of the species and monitoring are carried out each year. International protection of key wetland habitats for the species is provided by Special Protection Areas, Ramsar and the Bern Convention (Hearn 2004).Conservation Actions ProposedBetter quality and more widespread monitoring is needed for this species, particularly to assess the impact of hunting.

It requires dry slopes, banks, mounds, hummocks or patches of sand or clay for nesting sites, especially those commanding good views of the surrounding area (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species winters in open country on steppe and agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and wet meadows (Johnsgard 1978)), or in brackish (Kear 2005) and freshwater marshy habitats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). It may also roost on tidal marshes, in sheltered bays or in estuaries and frequents inland lakes and reservoirs in North America (Kear 2005).

The nest is a shallow construction of plant matter on the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992) amongst vegetation such as grass or dwarf scrub heath, often on raised hummocks or slopes to reduce the risk of flooding and provide a vantage point of the surrounding area (Kear 2005). Usually five to six eggs, although larger clutches are thought to be laid by more than one female. The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of the roots, leaves, stems, seeds and fruits of terrestrial plants such as herbs, grasses and sedges (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), as well as agricultural grain, wheat, rice and barley (Johnsgard 1978), potatoes and sprouting cereals (especially in the winter). This species is fully migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), travelling in stages via several stop-over sites between separate breeding and wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988).","The species is threatened by intense hunting pressure (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) resulting in mortality and disturbance at staging (Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006). It is also susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Climatic changes are likely to cause range contractions in this species's already highly restricted breeding range (Kear 2005), and are already causing other species (e.g. Canada Geese (Branta Canadensis)) to move northward, increasing competition for resources (Kear 2005, Fox et al. 2006). Oil exploration in the tundra habitat poses a threat to the species's breeding (Kear 2005a) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006) through oil spills and chronic oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), by direct habitat destruction (influencing breeding site selection and reducing reproductive success) (Kear 2005) and through human disturbance (Glahder and Walsh 2006). Wetland habitat degradation due to drainage, peat-extraction and changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) is also a problem in areas of Russia (Grishanov 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I, II and III.

In Sweden the population was reinforced with captive bred birds since 1981 (Marchant and Musgrove 2011). A small wintering population is also now established in The Netherlands and Germany, which originates from the population in Sweden. There are important staging areas in Estonia (Tolvanen et al. 1999), Lithuania and Poland (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The European population is estimated at 140-310 pairs, which equates to 280-620 mature individuals.

It can also be found on the slopes by the lower parts of mountain streams, on mountain foothills, mountain lakes and on alpine precipices, often in thawing boggy areas or on stone fields (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978). It often nests on snow-free patches available early in the breeding season (such as rocky outcrops or prominent hummocks) hidden amongst vegetation or in boggy hollows (Madsen 1996, Kear 2005), usually in close proximity to open water or marshy areas (Kear 2005). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with grass, moss and down and frequently the same site is used in subsequent seasons. Clutch size is normally four to six (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). This species is herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, stems, leaves, fruits and the green parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants. During the winter the species supplements its diet with winter agricultural grains. This species is fully migratory (Kear 2005). The species departs from its breeding grounds in northern Scandinavia and arctic Russia in late August to early September and travels to wintering grounds in south-east Europe and the Middle East (Alerstam 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998). Small wintering populations, originating from the reinforcement of the breeding population in Sweden, are now established in the Netherlands and Germany (Hornman et al. 2012, Kruckenberg and Krüger 2013). The return passage to the breeding grounds begins in February, with the species arriving from early May (Snow and Perrins 1998) to late June (Madsen 1996).","Illegal spring hunting and round-ups of moulting birds are taking place on the Russian breeding grounds (Jones 2011) and illegal shooting continues in Norway (T. Aarvak pers. comm. 2007). In the western Palearctic at least 20–30% of the population are shot each year (Mooij 2010) often accidentally during the hunting of other species. Habitat deterioration, as a result of land cultivation and increased water-levels in the Caspian Sea, is a further threat (Madsen 1996), as is habitat loss through the creation of reservoirs for hydroelectric power in Scandinavia (Madsen 1996). The species may also be threatened by nest predation from the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (Madsen 1996) and the restocked population in Sweden has suffered from predation by White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) (Jones et al. 2008). Disturbance on breeding grounds (e.g. from increasing tourism and angling) causes much disruption to nesting birds (Madsen 1996). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 28% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). Outside of the breeding season, high mortality in autumn and winter is caused by illegal hunting, and accidental shooting on the staging and wintering grounds is the most important threat (Madsen 1996, Aarvak et al.1997, Lorentsen et al. 1998, Kear 2005, Morozov 2006, Jones 2011). Disturbance of roosting and feeding birds by hunters is a potentially significant limiting factor on survival and breeding output (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995, N. Petkov in litt. 2007). In the Kaliningrad region of Russia, important migratory stop-over points on the Baltic Sea coastline are being degraded through petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for agriculture, changes in wetland management leading to scrub and reed overgrowth, peat extraction, and the burning and mowing of reed beds (Grishanov 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II.

Satellite telemetry studies have improved knowledge of its ecology and the key threats (Aarvak et al.1997, Tolvanen et al. 1999). Satellite tracking was also carried out as part of a recent European LIFE project, which also enabled the preparation of National Action Plans for Norway, Finland and Estonia, habitat management and restoration in Estonia and Hungary and awareness campaigns, especially targeting hunters and farmers (Tonlaven et al. 2009). A European Action Plan was published in 1996 (Madsen 1996) and an updated International Single Species Action Plan for the western Palearctic population was published in 2008 (Jones et al. 2008). Several captive breeding populations exist (AEWA). A restocking programme in Sweden was ongoing until 2000, when concerns were raised regarding the presence of Great White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) mtDNA in the released captive bred birds (Ruokonen et al. 2007, Marchant and Musgrove 2011). At least 3-7% of birds released in Sweden until that time were estimated to be carrying DNA from Greater White-fronted Goose. Releases in Sweden of birds from a stock originating from Russia resumed in 2010 (Naturvårdsverket 2011).Conservation Actions ProposedReduce illegal hunting pressure in key wintering and staging areas.

Its range has contracted locally in many parts of Europe, which is thought to be mainly due to habitat changes, including the loss of suitable nest-sites and, less often, the use of pesticides. Industrialised farming practices have resulted in a reduction of prey items such as voles and earthworms. Agricultural intensification, ground clearance, excessive use of toxic chemicals and road traffic deaths all contribute to declines as well (Holt et al. 2014).

The maintenance of perches near roads (2 m high, 10–15 m apart and 5 m from the road), is advisable to help reduce car-collisions. Further research into habitat requirements, population size and trends and threats is required (Tucker and Heath 1994).",,

Breeding may begin in February, in good vole years (Mikkola 1983) and continue until July (Holt et al. 1999) but most eggs are laid in April. It nests in holes, such as disused woodpecker holes or where these are not available it will use nest boxes. No nest is made and eggs are laid directly onto debris, although if there is soft material in the hole it will make a shallow depression (Mikkola 1983). Clutches are usually three to seven eggs. It feeds principally on small voles as well as mice, shrews and small birds (Snow and Perrins 1998), but also recorded taking flying squirrels, bats, frogs and beetles (Mikkola 1983). This species is generally a year-round resident within a stable home range, but it disperses in years when prey is scarce (Holt et al. 1999).","The breeding population of this species fluctuates with vole cycles and the depth of annual snow cover, which inhibits foraging. Forestry can reduce primary prey populations, remove forest structure necessary for foraging, and eliminate nest cavities (Holt et al. 1999). At one time the species frequently used old Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) holes but declines in the species has resulted in less nesting opportunities (Mikkola 1983). Tawny owls (Strix aluco) and martens (Martes spp.) are serious predators of this species and in some years the latter can destroy a high percentage of broods and kill many females on the nest. In Germany, the Nuthatch (Sitta europea) may reduce the size of nest-hole entrances with plastered mud and has even been known to wall in brooding females, resulting in the birds starving to death. It is also vulnerable to pesticides (König et al. 2008)","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II. Nest boxes have been employed extensively in Europe to help mitigate loss of nest-sites and to monitor demographic characteristics, for example by ringing nestlings; Around 11,000 boxes have been installed in Finland from which fledglings ringed annually (Holt et al. 1999).Conservation Actions ProposedCareful forestry management is required for this species. Selective harvesting may allow tree removal while maintaining suitable habitat for the species. In addition, because forest succession is slow in spruce-fir forest, practices must acknowledge that clear-felled sites will remain unsuitable for roosting or foraging for up to a century, and new nest trees will not develop for up to two centuries (Holt et al. 1999). The provision of nest boxes has proved effectiveand this practice should continue. Predation by martens can be reduced by placing a strip of metal or plastic c. 50 cm wide above and below nest holes and the use of ‘anti-marten’ boxes can be effective (König et al. 2008).",,

In mainland Europe, breeding occurs in edge woodland and scrub and in Britain it favours shelterbelts, small groves and thickets surrounded by moorland, grassland, marshes or farmland. Outside the breeding season it is found in similar habitats, including farmland with hedgerows. The breeding season is from February to July (Olsen 1999). It uses the abandoned stick nests of other species, such as crows (Corvus), magpies (Pica), raptors, herons (Ardea) (König and Weick 2008). It also accepts artificial baskets, and sometimes lays in cavities in trees or cliffs, or on the ground. Clutches are generally five to seven eggs. It feeds principally on small mammals, although some studies have found birds to be important (Olsen 1999). The species is mainly migratory in Fennoscandia and Russia but further south in Europe it is more sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Declines in Britain are thought to be due to the expanding population of Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), competing for space, food and nest sites (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Olsen 1999). Agricultural intensification and declining vole populations are also driving declines in Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Locally, threats include pesticide use, persecution and road traffic collisions (König and Weick 2008).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. Bern Convention Appendix II. In Britain the species has benefited from the provision of artificial nesting sites (Marks et al. 1994).Conservation Actions ProposedIt is suggested that road collisions could be decreased by reducing the availability of small rodents in close proximity to roads, through allowing vegetation to grow naturally or by planting short bushes (Baudvin 1997). Management to prevent vole declines should involve the creation of a mosaic of different habitat types with grassland mown at different times of the year together with undisturbed strips (Aschwanden et al. 2005). Breeding can be encouraged through the provision of artificial nesting platforms and open fronted nestboxes (Olsen 1999). In addition in harsh winters, food supplies can be augmented through the provision of feeding stations near day roosts (König and Weick 2008).",,

In Europe, this species breeds mainly on tundra, moorland, marshes and bogs, in newly cleared forest and young evergreen plantations, in uncultivated grassland and in steppe (Olsen et al. 2013). It breeds between late march and June and generally lays seven to ten eggs (König 2008). It nests on the ground on a dry site, sometimes in wetter situation and female shows tendency to build nest (almost unique behaviour among Strigidae) (Olsen et al. 2013). It feeds mostly on small mammals but also other small vertebrates and insects (König 2008), but usually relies on rodent populations which can determine its spatial distribution and nesting success (Hagemejer and Blair 1997). In the north of its range it is thought to be highly migratory although migration may be confused with nomadic food searches and juvenile dispersal. Wintering areas may also become breeding areas if food is plentiful (Olsen et al. 2013).","Due to its nesting habits and nomadic nature, the species is vulnerable to habitat loss at any season; conversion of open habitats to agriculture, grazing, recreation, housing and resort development is a key factor in decline, as well as reforestation in some areas. Wind-turbine developments may also impact the species. In central Europe declines have been caused by drainage and the intensification of agriculture, together with persecution, rodenticide poisoning, urbanization and traffic mortality. It does not always occupy apparently suitable habitat, which may be due to levels of prey or predation or the effects of distribution and abundance.

Disturbance from recreational use of heathlands and road deaths may also contribute to its decline (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species has numerous predators, especially of eggs and chicks, including: crows (Corvus), Magpies (Pica pica), Jays (Garrulus glandarius), owls (Strigidae), Sooty Falcon (Falco concolor), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), weasels (Mustela nivalis) and domestic dogs (Cleere and Christie 2013).

Further work should be undertaken to restore heathlands, including those in planted forests to prevent fragmentation and increase spatial connectivity and agri-environment schemes to help provide foraging habitat should be developed. Visitor numbers to important heathland areas should be minimised to reduce disturbance and the development of urban areas near by prevented.

A small amount of illegal hunting occurs at drinking sites. As it is a tree-nesting species, predation by introduced mammals including rats is of less significance than for C. junoniae but it remains a potential threat, the impact of which has not been fully assessed (Hernández et al. 1999). Grazing pressure from sheep is leading to habitat degradation on La Gomera and at El Hierro. Forest fires also pose a moderate threat to its habitat (BirdLife International 2010). Recreational activities cause some disturbance in the breeding season. The species is potentially threatened by outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Tuberculosis (BirdLife International 2010).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU birds Directive Annex I.

Hunting has only been a residual threat since hunting-free zones (coinciding with reserves) were implemented. The restoration of pine forest and thermophile forest is still pending full implementation. As part of a LIFE project (2005-2008), work has been carried out to eradicate exotic plant species, plant native species, raise public awareness and increase knowledge of the survival of different native species present in thermophilous forests. Tenerife has undertaken a major effort in eradicating Monterey pine and replanting with native species. Also in Tenerife, Canarian pine tree plantations are partly cleared (thinned) which makes them more suitable for the species.

It therefore qualifies as Near Threatened in both Europe and the EU27.  ",Unknown,"The species is endemic to the Canary Islands, Spain, where it occurs on the islands of La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife and El Hierro (González 1996, Martín and Lorenzo 2001), and formerly on Gran Canaria (Barov and Derhé 2011). The largest subpopulation is found on La Palma, where it occurs across much of the northern half of the island. The species is common on La Gomera, where it is found primarily in the north, and also occurs patchily on the northern slopes of Tenerife. It has recently also been recorded on El Hierro; however, breeding there has not yet been confirmed (Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Martín et al. 2000).","The European population is estimated at 1,000-2,500 mature individuals. The entire population is found in the EU27. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species prefers thermophilous forest, with a potential altitudinal range of 200–500 m Asl on the north slopes of the islands, and 600–1,000 m in the south (Nogales et al. 2009) and occurs in areas with steep slopes, escarpments and gullies, as well as in laurel forest and Canary pine forest, and cultivated areas (Martín et al. 2000). The breeding season varies between islands, but extends from January to September, with a peak between April-June. At least on Tenerife, breeding success appears to be low, as a consequence of intense nest predation (Hernández et al. 1999, Martín et al. 2000). Nests are on the ground (in fissures, holes or small ledges, at the bases of trees, and under rocks or fallen tree trunks) in steep, rocky, shady areas with abundant shrubby vegetation (Martín et al. 2000). Clutch is one, occasionally two eggs. It feeds mostly on fruit, buds, some grain and flowers. A large part of its diet is made up of fruits of Ocotea foetens and Persea indica. It forages both in trees and on the ground and locally also feeds in orchards. The species is sedentary but sometimes moves from upland forests to lowland agricultural areas to feed (Baptista et al. 1997).","Habitat loss has been extensive. Dry and laurel forests have been intensively exploited since the 15th century, and some areas of remaining forest continue to be felled and fragmented owing to the demand for wooden stakes and poles for agriculture, particularly vine-growing (Martín et al. 2000, Hernández 2004). Grazing by livestock, notably sheep, is degrading habitat on El Hierro and La Gomera. Predation of eggs and chicks by rats, and of nesting adults by feral cats (Felis catus), are important threats (Hernández 2004), particularly on Tenerife where five of seven nests monitored were predated, primarily by black rats (Rattus rattus) (Hernández et al. 1999, Martín et al. 2000). Illegal hunting remains a threat, especially when birds concentrate at drinking and feeding sites (Hernández 2004). Recreational activities such as climbing, abseiling, quad-biking, mountain-biking and motocross may disturb nesting birds (Hernández 2004, Barov and Derhé 2011). The species is potentially threatened by outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Tuberculosis (Barov and Derhé 2011).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Bird Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II.

It uses a wide variety of woodland types. It tolerates humans but does not breed close to towns or villages (Baptista et al. 2013). It breeds at low altitudes not exceeding 500 m in the temperate zone and up to 1,000?1,300 m in Mediterranean areas (Tucker & Heath 1994). Breeding commences in May. It lays two eggs (Baptista et al. 2013). The nest is a small platform of twigs lined with plant material and placed in the lowest parts of trees (Tucker & Heath 1994) and in shrubs and hedges. It mainly feeds on the ground taking seeds and fruits of weeds and cereals, but also berries, fungi and invertebrates. It is strongly migratory (Baptista et al. 2013), wintering south of the Sahara from Senegal east to Eritrea and Ethiopia (Tucker & Heath 1994).","Transformation of agricultural land, including destruction of hedges, is thought to be an important factor in the decline of this species, also loss of semi-natural habitats. Changes in agriculture practices have several impacts on the species, as they can both reduce food supply and nesting habitat availability and it is likely that the decline in food is the main limiting factor rather than decline in nest site availability (Lutz 2006). Widespread use of chemical herbicides appears to also be a very serious factor, with consequent decline or elimination of many food plants. Hunting is also significant, during migration and in winter quarters; with annual toll in France computed at 40,000 birds (Baptista et al. 2013). The species is also vulnerable to infection by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas gallinae, which causes mortality (Stockdale et al. 2014). Severe drought in the Sahel zone is thought to be a possible factor in the decline as well as competition with Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) (Lutz 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex II. In the UK, it is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.Conservation Actions ProposedBreeding and staging habitats should be managed (Lutz 2006), ensuring the conservation and re-creation of hedges with hawthorn (Crataegus) which is a favoured tree for breeding and also the reduction in agricultural herbicides (Tucker and Heath 1994). Restrictions on hunting to avoid affecting late breeding birds and birds during spring migration should be introduced and enforced. Annual national bag statistics where hunting takes place must be collected in order to develop a level of hunting which is sustainable.

It is therefore classified as Vulnerable in both Europe and the EU27. ",Decreasing,"The species has two widely separated breeding populations. In its eastern range it occurs, in Europe, in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and Turkey. Its western range covers Spain and Portugal, with smaller populations in Italy and France. Eastern populations winter from Turkey and the Caucasus to Iran, and erratically elsewhere in south Asia. Azerbaijan holds the main wintering quarters, with the Adjinohur valley and Shirvan National Park supporting large numbers (Gauger and Heiß 2010). Western populations winter in the Mediterranean zone, with the Iberian peninsula holding the most important wintering quarters. Whilst it remains widespread and numerous, in some parts of its range it has declined dramatically since the 19th century, leading to extinctions in at least 11 European countries and probably as a breeding bird in Azerbaijan. The species has now disappeared from mainland Italy, where it occurred in Apulia (V. Bretagnolle in litt. 2007).","The European population is estimated at 60,900-120,000 males, which equates to 122,000-240,000 mature individuals. The population in the EU27 is estimated at 56,800-111,000 502, which equates to 114,000-222,000 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species inhabits dry grassland and, in Europe, it also occurs in areas of low-intensity arable cultivation and pastoral land, selecting areas with a high diversity of ground cover such as mosaics of pasture, stubble fields, long-rotation fallow land and legume crops (Martin et al. 2010). Wintering birds in Azerbaijan prefer semi-desert and steppe areas under winter pasturing, and avoid areas of intensive agriculture (Gauger 2007). Breeding occurs from February until to June (Collar et al. 2014). The species is polygamous (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997); females mate with males on their displaying ground then nest and raise the young alone (Tucker and Heath 1994). The nest is a shallow scrape usually in dense, short grass cover. Clutches range from two to six eggs (Collar et al. 2014).  Beetles, grasshoppers and other terrestrial invertebrates are a vital source of food in the summer and are fed to the chicks; in the winter plant material (e.g. shoots, leaves, flowerheads and seeds) is more dominant in the diet (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar et al. 2014). The species varies in its migratory or resident character across its distribution. In the north and especially in eastern Europe it is migratory as are the breeding birds in France. In Iberia the species is partially migratory, the main wintering grounds being in the south-west of the peninsula (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The primary cause of its decline has been conversion of dry grassland and low-intensity cultivation to intensive arable agriculture, especially where this has included the planting of monocultures or perennial crops, irrigation or afforestation. The fragmentation of traditional habitats, by means of agricultural intensification or infrastructure development, negatively affects habitat availability and quality for the species, as well as male density (E. García in litt. 2007, García et al. 2007) as displaying males exhibit a preference for old and same-year fallows which offer shelter and food (Delgado et al. 2010). The use of pesticides could reduce food availability (E. García in litt. 2007). Harvesting with modern farm machinery, operated at high speed and often during the night, is the key threat to females and nests in Europe and is the cause for the observed male-biased sex structure and low fecundity (Iñigo and Barov 2010). Farm machinery accounts for 40% of clutch failure in south-west France (Inchausti and Bretagnolle 2005). Conversion to intensive arable agriculture continues to be the primary threat and cause of continuing declines in Europe (E. García in litt. 2007). It also suffers from illegal hunting (Y. Andryuschenko in litt. 1999), although this is a minor threat (V. Bretagnolle in litt. 2007). The collision of birds with overhead powerlines is a locally important cause of mortality (E. García in litt. 2007). The release of farm-reared gamebirds could eventually introduce new pathogens to wild populations of the species (E. García in litt. 2007). In Azerbaijan, the main threats are disturbance from intensive land use (mainly heavy grazing), habitat loss to infrastructure development and probably hunting (Gauger 2007). Climate change effects could lead to shorter rainy seasons and reduced winter precipitation in southern Europe which could have a detrimental effect on habitat quality for the species (Delgado et al. 2009, Delgado and Moreira 2010).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. A European action plan was published in 2001 (E. García in litt. 2007), its implementation was reviewed (Barov and Derhé 2011) and updated (Iñigo and Barov 2010) in 2010. A species action plan for the species in Sardinia is in preparation. In Catalonia, Management Plans for the SPA with a Little Bustard population have been developed. The species has been the subject of several LIFE Nature projects in Portugal, Spain, France and Italy. France and Spain have attempted a joint programme of reinforcement of the populations in central and western France by release of captive-bred chicks during 2006-2009. In France, targeted agri-environmental measures (MAET) have been developed and tested in the region of Poitou-Charentes. Management agreements have been elaborated and signed with farmers, which are believed to have led to an increase of the affected populations (Leitão et al. 2006, Bamière et al. 2011, Bretagnolle et al. 2011). In France, Spain and Portugal national censuses take place every five years (four in France). The number of protected areas established in steppe habitats in those countries has increased.Conservation Actions ProposedCarry out coordinated surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate for the total population. Continue to conduct surveys to monitor population trends. Preserve habitat and alter land-use practices through EU and national policies.

A high diversity of low-intensity land-use and lack of disturbance are generally important for year round needs (Collar & Garcia 2013). Nest sites are selected in fallow or cereal fields (primarily alfalfa in central Europe) in areas of low patch-type diversity, far from human infrastructure and with good horizontal visibility (Magaña et al. 2010). Females mate with males on lekking grounds (Tucker and Heath 1994) then incubate a clutch of two to three eggs. It nests with or without a scrape, occasionally with fragments of grass stems and crop stems as lining. The diet consists principally of plant material and invertebrates, although small mammals, amphibians and nestling birds are sometimes taken. In Europe the species is generally sedentary but can be dispersive in Iberia, central and eastern Europe to the Ukraine depending on weather, age and sex (Collar and Garcia 2013).","Key threats are increased habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to agricultural intensification, land-use changes and infrastructure development which has the potential to increase following land privatisation in eastern Europe (S. Nagy in litt. 1999, 2007, Nagy 2009). Habitat loss and fragmentation continues as a result of ploughing of grasslands, intensive grazing, afforestation and increasing development of irrigation schemes, roads, power-lines, fencing and ditches. Mechanisation, chemical fertilisers, pesticides, fire and predation all contribute to high mortality in eggs, chicks, juveniles and incubating females (Nagy 2009). Hunting is a major threat in Turkey and Ukraine (Y. Andryucshenko in litt. 1999, P. Goriup in litt. 2007). Collision with power lines (J. C. Alonso in litt. 2007, Nagy 2009, M.

In its breeding range the species inhabits grassy steppes of feather grass (Stipa) and fescue (Festuca), and dry areas dominated by wormwood (Artemisia), the essential habitat requirement being access to water for drinking. It can be found on hilly steppes along wide river valleys, shrubby steppes and semi-desert, forest edge habitats, and occasionally unvegetated alkaline flats, or large expanses of rock or gravel. It will often forage in damp marshes and swamps, and is regularly found in cultivated areas (Johnsgard 1983). It returns in flocks from its wintering areas to breed in March and April (sometimes as late as early-June in the north) (Archibald et al. 2013). The nest is a shallow scrape (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) (although often no attempt is made to find or construct a cavity) (Johnsgard 1983), on dry ground, lined or surrounded by pebbles and plant materials (eggs may be laid directly onto the ground). The nest may be placed on gravel (Archibald et al. 2013) in areas partially or entirely free of vegetation (Johnsgard 1983), or in open patches of grass and cultivation, usually less than 1-2 km away from a source of water (Johnsgard 1983, Urban et al. 1986). Clutches are usually two eggs (Archibald et al. 2013). The diet of this species consists mainly of plant material (Snow and Perrins 1998), although lizards and small invertebrates such as large insects and worms (Archibald et al. 2013) are also taken during the summer (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species will forage in cultivated fields (Johnsgard 1983), feeding on ripening cereal crops in its breeding grounds (Johnsgard 1983) and peanuts, beans and other crops on migration (Meine and Archibald 1996).

Other threats include disturbance due to rising human populations (Ellis et al. 1996), intensive use of pesticides (Ellis et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996, Archibald et al. 2013), and shooting and intentional poisoning in some areas where crop damage occurs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Ellis et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996).

In recent years, only one pair from the Black Sea population has bred within a protected area, at Azov-Sivash National Park in Ukraine. Conservation programmes such as those in the Ukraine, have thus far, focused on analyzing the factors affecting the species in agricultural settings, and identifying methods to reduce negative impacts. Surveys have been undertaken in areas such as Ukraine and Georgia. In 1992, the Azov-Black Sea Ornithological Station in Ukraine established ""The Virgo Programme"" to monitor this and other rare and disappearing bird species of the Ukrainian steppes. Research  has focused on distribution, population numbers, biology, flock movements, breeding ecology and migration patterns from various portions of its main breeding range. Education programs involving the species have also been initiated in Ukraine (Meine and Archibald 1996).Conservation Actions ProposedThe species would benefit from stronger protection of the Black Sea population and its habitats by strengthening the network of protected areas, as well as the  protection of breeding habitat outside of protected areas by working with landholders to implement conservation measures. Long term monitoring should be continued and expanded and surveys conducted to determine the size of the Turkish population, assess its habitat and potential threats. Continue research, focusing on the breeding biology, range, migration, habitat requirements and threats to the species. Organize migration watches in the Balkan Peninsula and Cyprus. Educational programs for use throughout the population?s range should be developed. Examine the historic range and habitats of the Black Sea population, and the potential for its eventual re-establishment in areas from which it has been extirpated or now occurs only during migration.

The nest is a mound of wetland vegetation (which may be re-used from year to year), generally placed in or near water in inaccessible undisturbed bog, heath, marsh, mire (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986), or sedge meadow (Malik and Prange 1995). Usually two eggs are laid (Archibald et al. 2013). The species is omnivorous in both breeding and non-breeding seasons (Cramp and Simmons 1980). This species is fully migratory, although isolated breeding populations east and south of the Black Sea may be resident or only undertake local movements (Snow and Perrins 1998).","In both its breeding and non-breeding ranges this species is principally threatened by habitat loss and degradation through dam construction, urbanisation and agricultural expansion (including changes in land-use, intensification, expanded irrigation systems and conversion of traditional holm oak pastures) (Meine and Archibald 1996). In parts of its breeding range that are heavily developed the species is threatened by nest disturbance from tourism and recreation which reduces its breeding success by increasing the incidence of successful nest predation by corvids, wild boar and foxes (Meine and Archibald 1996). Egg collecting is also a threat to the breeding population in Turkey (Meine and Archibald 1996). Along its migrational routes and in its wintering grounds the species is particularly threatened by habitat fragmentation and the loss of many smaller traditional feeding and roosting sites, leading to increasing concentrations of large flocks in smaller areas, and therefore increased competition (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Alonso et al. 1994, Meine and Archibald 1996). Pesticide poisoning may also be affecting cranes along migration routes and in some wintering areas, especially where they depend primarily on grain from agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996). Collisions with utility lines are frequent in highly developed areas along migration routes and in winter ranges (collisions being the leading cause of adult mortality at wintering areas in Spain) (Meine and Archibald 1996). Hunting is a significant threat to this species on migration (Meine and Archibald 1996, Nawaz et al. 2006) and illegal shooting has been identified as a problem in other areas (including Portugal and south-east Europe) (Meine and Archibald 1996).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. CMS Appendix II. The species is legally protected across all of its European range, although stronger enforcement is needed in many areas. The European Crane Working Group (ECWG) has coordinated conservation activities including research, monitoring, colour banding, habitat protection, education, and recommended changes in agricultural policy, since the mid-1980s. Some breeding areas are within protected areas in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Spain and Germany. Intensive habitat management in western Europe, including the creation and restoration of wetlands, agreements with private land owners to protect key resting and wintering habitats, clearing of dense vegetation from roosting areas, development of habitat management plans for protected areas, burial or relocation of utility lines, programs to encourage planting of lure crops and use of waste grain for diversionary feeding; and compensation programs for farmers suffering crop damage have resulted in breeding pairs resettling former breeding habitats. Breeding populations have been most closely monitored in Scandinavia, the Baltic nations, Poland, and Germany and in recent years, surveys have been conducted regularly at key staging and wintering areas in Russia, Spain, Germany, France, Portugal, Hungary, Sweden and Estonia. Intensive research in Europe has focused on demographics, life history, feeding and wintering behavior, and habitat and conservation needs (Meine and Archibald 1996).  Reintroduction of the species to the southwest U.K. began in 2010 with released birds establishing territories and nests (The Great Crane Project 2014).Conservation Actions ProposedLegal protection of wetlands and other habitats in the species's breeding grounds, along its migratory routes, and in its wintering grounds should be strengthened. Cooperative international conservation programs involving the countries along main migratory routes should be established and international research expanded. Protected areas at important breeding, staging, resting, and wintering areas should be established or expanded and enforcement and management of existing protected areas strengthened. Other measures include the continuation of research and censusing, addressing crop degradation problems, education and captive propagation and release (Meine and Archibald 1996).",,

It is strongly associated with agricultural grassland managed for the production of hay (Barnes 2000). Suitable habitats include moist, unfertilised grassland and regularly cut meadows in areas of low-intensity agriculture where vegetation grows tall in summer. Across its European range, hay or silage fields in valleys liable to flooding seem of most importance, but birds also breed in hay and silage fields in subalpine areas. Wetlands and marsh edges may act as important refuges when drier habitats are unsuitable (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). It avoids very marshy areas, standing water, river and lake margins and open ground with rocks, stones and gravel (Taylor and de Juana 2014), and also those areas with a thick layer of dead grass or very dense vegetation above 50 cm tall (Cramp and Simmons 1980). During migration it occurs in a variety of habitats including wheat fields and on golf courses. It breeds from April to August (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The nest is on the ground in dense vegetation and is constructed from dead stems and leaves (Green et al. 1997). Often surrounding stems are pulled over the top to form a loose canopy (Taylor and de Juana 2014). The average clutch-size is c.10 eggs and two broods may be raised per season (Green et al. 1997). It feeds on a wide range of invertebrates including insects, snails and slugs, arachnids, millipedes, earthworms. It is also known to consume young frogs, green parts of plants, young shoots and seeds and possibly even small mammals and birds (Cramp and Simmons 1980). The species is a long-distance migrant (Taylor and de Juana 2014), wintering in central and southern Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Chick mortality due to mechanized mowing and consequent increased predation is considered to be the primary threat in Europe (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Intensification of grassland management and the loss of hay meadows and wetlands are considered as the critical threats to its habitats (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Following privatisation, potential changes to land-use and management of agricultural land in the species's core breeding range in Russia and eastern Europe are also possible threats (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). Land abandonment temporarily favours the species, but areas become unsuitable as vegetation becomes too dense and scrub develops. Intensified management of hay meadows, or their conversion to arable, is resulting in widespread habitat loss (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). Across western and central Europe, intensification of grassland management, leading to earlier and rapid mowing of hay and silage, is the main threat (N. Schäffer in litt. 2003). Early mowing and the use of mechanised methods results in the destruction of nests and chicks (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). It is a quarry species in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia, but hunting pressure is considered low. Illegal hunting of the species during the Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) hunting season has been reported from Bulgaria and Croatia, and 0.5-2.7% of the European population may be susceptible to capture in netting set up for C. coturnix in Egypt each autumn. Introduced mammals, such as domestic cats and the American mink (Mustela vison), are reported to be predators of the species's nests, in addition to native species. The species may be disturbed by recreational activities and developments, such as motorways (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Late spring floods can reduce local populations by around 50% (Donaghy 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS (Bonn Convention) Appendix II. Bern Convention Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. The species is legally protected from hunting in most of the countries in its breeding range (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Conservation measures have been taken in 14 European range states. National action plans have been prepared in Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Denmark, U.K. and Slovakia. Appropriate habitat management techniques have been researched, and local repeat surveys in Russia show relative stability of the population (A. Mischenko in litt. 2006). A European action plan was published in 1996 and a revised version published in 2006 (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006), and a Corncrake Conservation Team was established in 1998. There is an ongoing reintroduction programme in England, U.K. (Newbery (2006).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor numbers through regular coordinated surveys, and improve monitoring in key countries (e.g. Russia, Belarus) (Doga Dernegi 2006, Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Monitor habitat condition and extent (Doga Dernegi 2006, Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Ensure that agri-environmental measures for the species in the EU are well targeted and implemented, and focus on mowing date and methods suitable for the species. Increase the area of suitable habitat with protected status. Restore lost habitat where possible. Conduct further research into the species's ecology and demography (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Work with farmers and land managers to ensure that traditional farming methods are retained, areas of grass are left uncut and harvest times are delayed (Doga Dernegi 2006). Monitor levels of illegal trapping and hunting (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006).

The young birds stay near the nest for another three to four days, before they disperse.  The species leaves the breeding grounds in late June to early August (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). During the breeding season they mainly feed on invertebrates and to a lesser extent on seeds and other plant materials (Copete 2011).","The population underwent a strong decline in Europe between 1970 and 1990 (BirdLife International 2004). The trend 1890–2011 is uncertain (BirdLife International 2015). It is likely that the long-term decline is related to the intensification of farming practices: scale-enlargement (destruction of hedgerows and shrubs), heavy pesticide use and changes in land-use: replacement of olive groves by maize fields and cornfields by commercial fruit-growing (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997).",Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is classified as Near Threatened in the Italian Red List Data Book (Peronace 2011).Conservation Actions ProposedMaintain crop mosaic farmland in the species's breeding areas (Brambilla 2015).,,

In Siberia it breeds in willow thickets in floodplains. In some regions the species has colonised drier habitats such as young woodland and farmland (maize, cereals and oil-seed rape fields) (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). Oil-seed rape fields have even become the most important breeding habitat for the species in lowland Britain (Gruar et al. 2006). The breeding season starts in early April and ends in August, depending on latitude and altitude. The species is mostly monogamous. The nest is built by the female, mostly on the ground, but sometimes in shrubs. The clutch, usually four or five eggs is incubated by both sexes. The chicks hatch after 12–15 days. They are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 9–12 days. The diet consists mainly of invertebrates during the breeding season and mainly seeds and other plant material at other times of the year. The species is partly migratory, in particular the northern and western European breeding birds, depending on the mean winter temperature. During the winter the species is also found in open fields, agricultural areas and woodland clearings (Copete 2011). Nowadays, in Central Europe it favours fallow and stubble fields overgrown with Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus forming important winter food sources for the species (Orlowki & Czarnecka 2007).","Agricultural intensification is considered the main cause of the decline of the species in Europe and especially the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica (Vera et al. 2014). In particular the availability of winter food in farmland has declined as a consequence of crop change and the use of herbicides, resulting in the disappearance of weed-rich stubbles, and the use of advanced technologies reducing the amount of spilled grain (Peach et al. 1999, Orlowki & Czarnecka 2007). In addition the destruction of wetlands and unfavourable management (e.g. intensive reed cutting) is another important threat to the species, including the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica (Vera et al. 2014).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Mediterranean subspecies (E. s. witherbyi) and the north-western Iberian subspecies (E. s. lusitanica) are classified as Endangered in the Spanish Red List (Atienza & Copete 2014). The species has been moved from the Red to the Amber list of Birds of Conservation Concern in Britain (Eaton et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedImplement marsh bird-friendly management of wetlands, for example avoid complete mowing or burning of older reed beds (Pasinelli& Schiegg 2012, Vera et al. 2014). Wintering habitat should be improved by preserving stubble fields. In addition the presence of heavily overgrown root crop and vegetable stubbles should be allowed to ensure the spontaneous regeneration of plant cover on fallows. These objectives should be promoted as part of agri-environmental schemes or within set-aside land options (Orlowki & Czarnecka 2007).Special attention should be paid to safeguard the small remaining populations of the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica by conducting annual censuses of the subspecies's population numbers, protecting all wetlands where it still occurs and conducting research on its taxonomy and ecology, in particular the species habitat requirements and pressures limiting the population. Other measures include compiling a national subspecies action plan; promoting extensive agricultural practices in areas surrounding the species's habitat in particular with regard to the use of insecticides; and maintaining fallow and stubble fields near its breeding areas as wintering feeding habitat (Atienza & Copete 2014).",,

In southern Europe it has a broader habitat array occupying several types of open country, including grasslands and steppes. It avoids extensive bush cover. The species is mainly sedentary. During winter it gathers in flocks and may show rather short distance displacements to favourable feeding grounds, often fallow or stubble fields (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Bos & van Noorden 2010, Madge 2011). The breeding season starts relatively late, from late May onward in north-western populations, but probably earlier in southern European populations. The nest is placed on the ground, hidden among vegetation. It is entirely built by the female. The clutch, usually four to six eggs, is incubated by the female alone. The incubation period is 12–14 days. The chicks are fed by the female (with the male in attendance) and leave the nest after 9–13 often before being able to fly (Madge 2011). The species's diet consists mainly of plant seeds, but during the breeding season it includes a high percentage of invertebrates, primarily small insects (Madge 2011).","The strong decline of the species in north-western Europe is mainly a consequence of agricultural intensification. Cropped areas of spring-sown cereals have decreased, mowing of hay has been advanced and the use of pesticides has increased. Winter food supplies have decreased as a consequence of the loss of spring tillage, increased pesticide usage and improved harvesting and storage techniques. The increase of winter-sown cereal cropland has affected the species adversely through increased nest losses, as a consequence of early harvesting and the early ploughing of winter cereal stubble fields (Donald and Forrest 1995, Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011).The abolition of the European set-aside scheme is of great concern, not only for birds. Set-aside has provided valuable food and nesting sites for many farmland birds whose populations were declining due to agricultural intensification (BirdLife International 2008). The species may be vulnerable to climatic extremes along its northern range limits (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is classified as Critically Endangered on the Dutch Red List (Hustings et al. 2004) and Vulnerable on the Swiss Red List (Keller 2010). The species is on the British list of Birds of Conservation Concern (Eaton et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedMeasures related to the restoration of the species's habitat in farmland should be taken and effectively carried out in agri-environment schemes/targeted management interventions. Specific measures include: increasing invertebrate availability by providing grassy margins or beetle banks and by selective spraying of headlands (Brickle et al. 2000); providing early summer and late summer nesting habitat close to each other to give the species the opportunity to rear two broods in a season; winter barley or late mown hay grown alongside weed-rich or undersown spring cereals would be a good combination; set-aside or similar agri-environment crop types should remain uncut and unsprayed during the breeding season and should preferably be offered close to song-posts, such as overhead wires (Perkins et al. 2012); the provision of unharvested, extensively managed cereal crops as an agri-environment option where intensively managed cereal crops are the main nesting habitat (Setchfield et al. 2012); delayed mowing (as part of agri-environment schemes) in areas where the species still breeds in meadows could significantly improve its breeding performance (Perkins et al. 2013); measures aimed at providing winter food habitat, including stubble fields with cereal seeds (Perkins et al. 2007, Perkins 2008, Bos& van Noorden 2010).",,

During periods of flightless moult, adults also prefer more permanent open waters rich in submerged aquatic vegetation (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include open freshwater or slightly brackish (Langrand 1990, Gomez 2002) lakes, lagoons, ponds, dams, and permanent or temporary pans, flood-plains, sewage ponds, reed and Typha swamps (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Hockey et al. 2005), and occasionally rivers and tidal lagoons (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996). In Europe this species breeds in May.  Both sexes build the nest; a platform of reeds and other aquatic plant material built either on open water either anchored or on rafts of fresh, green reeds, or within emergent vegetation (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998) on a foundation of bent and trampled stems (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). No attempt at concealing the nest is made (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996), although the site chosen usually facilitates quick and easy access to open water (Hockey et al. 2005). Clutches are normally five to seven eggs (Taylor 1996). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting predominantly of the shoots, fruits and seeds of submerged or floating aquatic plants, filamentous and macroscopic algae (Hockey et al. 2005) and grass, as well as molluscs, crustaceans, insects and occasionally carrion (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996). This species is both sedentary and nomadic (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Hockey et al. 2005), often making local movements (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) in response to rainfall, water levels and the availability of its favoured foods (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Hockey et al. 2005).","The species is susceptible to avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease. It is also threatened by poisoning, both intentionally (pest control) and unintentionally (pesticides used on crops) (Hockey et al. 2005). The species is threatened in Spain (the northernmost range extremes) primarily by habitat loss and degradation due to changes in hydrological regime, over-exploitation of catchments and sedimentation (which are altering the periods of wetland flooding), agricultural, industrial and domestic pollution, overgrazing (cattle herds), the burning of reeds, and the introduction of alien species (e.g. Louisiana Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and Ciprinidae fish which both reduce the availability of food and hence increase competition) (Gomez 2000).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II.

It is sedentary in Iberia and nomadic or partially migratory in Turkey (de Juana and Boesman 2013).","The main threat to this species is the intensification of agriculture. Ploughing of pasture and irrigation have reduced available habitat while the removal of marginal areas of semi-natural vegetation and the increased application of agro-chemicals has reduced food availability and these practices have probably been responsible for the extinctions in some areas. On the remaining grasslands, overgrazing affects the vegetation composition and structure, reducing both food availability and cover for nesting. Conversely, land abandonment is also a major threat, as the open, treeless steppe habitat is quickly lost when grazing is removed. Hunting, which is legal in Turkey during the breeding season, may be a problem; the species's habit of concentrating in large numbers at traditional drinking sites throughout the year means that it forms an attractive and relatively easy target (Tucker and Heath 1994).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I.

The distribution of earthworms is an important habitat characteristic for the species throughout the year (Johnsgard 1981). For breeding the species requires extensive unfragmented areas (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) of broadleaved deciduous or mixed broadleaved/coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1981) containing a dense undergrowth of shrubs and ground cover (Lutz and Pagh Jensen 2005) (e.g. of brambles (Rubus spp.), holly (Ilex aquifolium), hazel (Corylus avellana), gorse (Ulex spp.), bracken (Pteridium spp.) or bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus)) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Lutz and Pagh Jensen 2005) and with a mosaic (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) of dry, warm resting places, moist areas for foraging (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986) (e.g. streams, springs or damp, swampy patches) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and clearings or other open areas as flight paths (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986).

It breeds from May to early September (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) in well-dispersed solitary pairs (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), after which (between August and September) adults undergo a flightless moulting period close to the breeding grounds. The autumn south-west migration occurs from mid-September to mid-November, with the species departing its wintering grounds again in March to mid-April. Outside of the breeding season the species remains largely solitary, usually feeding singly or in groups of up to five individuals. Most of its activities are carried out nocturnally or in the early morning and late evening (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species breeds in the northern taiga and forest tundra zones on open grassy marshes and bogs with swampy ground (Johnsgard 1981, (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996)) on flood-plains (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996)), in swampy coniferous forest, willow (Salix spp.) marshes or wet alder (Alnus spp.) woods (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season it inhabits both fresh and brackish wetlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) showing a preference for mosaics of moist and waterlogged mudflats with soft, silty mud and dense of tussocks vegetation (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Suitable habitats include swamps, fens (Snow and Perrins 1998), grassy marshes (Johnsgard 1981), the margins of rivers and streams (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), overgrown flood-lands, sewage farms (Snow and Perrins 1998), rice-fields (Johnsgard 1981), flooded arable fields, damp pastures and water meadows (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists of adult and larval insects, annelid worms, small freshwater and terrestrial gastropods and the seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic and shoreline plants (Johnsgard 1981). The nest is positioned on hummocks of sphagnum moss or grass tussocks on floating bogs just above the surrounding water (Johnsgard 1981), also on drier ground amongst bushes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g., dwarf birch (Betula nana) and heather) (Johnsgard 1981).","The species is threatened by the loss and degradation of its wetland habitats through afforestation, peat extraction and drainage for agricultural intensification (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It also suffers from lead poisoning as a result of ingesting lead shot deposited on wetlands (Olivier 2006). The species is hunted during the autumn migration (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. in Denmark) (Bregnballe et al. 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex II (A) and III (B) of the EU Birds Directive.

Two subspecies are found in Europe, L. l. islandica and L. l. limosa. Subspecies islandica breeds predominantly in Iceland, with much smaller numbers in the Faroe Islands, Shetland (United Kingdom) and the Lofoten Islands (Norway). Significant numbers of this subspecies overwinter in France (Triplet et al. 2007). Subspecies limosa breeds across a wide area extending from western Europe and central Europe to central Asia and Asiatic Russia. The European population of this subspecies migrates south through France and Iberia to winter in West Africa (Gill et al. 2007, Oomen 2008).","The European population is estimated at 102,000-149,000 pairs, which equates to 205,000-298,000 mature individuals. The population in the EU27 is estimated at 43,400-70,300 pairs, which equates to 86,800-141,000 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","In its breeding range this species mostly inhabits areas with high grass and soft soil (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils et al. 2014). Its preferred habitats include cattle pastures, hayfields (Johnsgard 1981), lowland wet grasslands, grassy marshland, raised bogs and moorland, lake margins and damp grassy depressions in steppes (Van Gils et al. 2014). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding populations in western European. In its non-breeding range, it inhabits wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp et al. 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994). Subspecies limosa tends to winter in freshwater habitats. Subspecies islandica, while it frequents staging sites at inland wetlands and flooded grasslands in the Netherlands, it often winters in brackish habitats (Van Gils et al. 2014). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between populations of subspecies limosa and islandica (Various 2007). It breeds from April to mid-June in loose, semi-colonial groups (Gunnarsson et al. 2006). The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxuriant vegetation (Johnsgard 1981, Cramp et al. 1983, Van Gils et al. 2014). It consists of a shallow scrape 12–15 cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp et al. 1983). Clutch size is normally four (Van Gils et al. 2014). Its diet consists of adult and larval insects, annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils et al. 2014). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains (Cramp et al. 1983, Van Gils et al. 2014). This species is highly gregarious and migrates on a broad front, making long-distance flights, often overland between relatively few staging and wintering areas. The species migrates southwards between late-June and October (Van Gils et al. 2014). The eastern Atlantic flyway population has important staging areas on the Iberian peninsula and winters in western Africa.","Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely, abandonment, are the most significant threats (Kentie et al. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land, increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland (Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), artificial flooding of nesting habitats, earlier and more frequent mowing as farmers adapt to earlier springs, spring burning, overgrowing by scrub, land claiming by businesses and developers, the construction of roads and parks, and disturbance by walkers (Tucker and Heath 1994, A. van Dijk in litt. 2005,  A. Mischenko in litt. 2007, Hayhow 2008, Oomen 2008, Holm and Laursen 2009, Kleijn et al. 2010, Kentie et al. 2013). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman et al. 2009). In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to sillage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007). Habitat fragmentation may cause particular problems for this species, which nests in dispersed colonies and sub-colonies as protection against predators and may be unlikely to breed successfully in small areas of habitat. The planned development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill et al. 2007, Masero et al. 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the EU in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield in litt. 2008) which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact are unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species's range (H. Hötker in litt. 2005), and drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994). The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestation of the lowland habitats where they breed (S. Nagy in litt. 2005). Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture and urban expansion. A study in the Netherlands suggests that climate change has driven an advance in agricultural activities to the detriment of this species (Kleijn et al. 2010). Juvenile birds which select good wintering sites also select good breeding sites (Gunnarsson et al. 2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds and slowing the rate of decline. There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande et al. 1980, Reijnen et al. 1996). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk et al. 1998). A recent study shows that recruiters from good quality habitats disperse to low quality habitats that act as sinks and so these individuals are considered 'lost' to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie 2015).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II. An EU management plan for 2007-2009 was adopted, and an AEWA action plan replaced it at the end of 2008 (Anon. 2008). Intensive management of breeding habitat has been carried out in some western European countries (H. Hötker in litt. 2005, Roodbergen& Teunissen 2014), and a number of agri-environment schemes focus on this species, although results have been mixed (Musters et al. 2001, S. Nagy in litt. 2005, Breeuwer et al. 2007,  A. Mischenko in litt. 2007, Verhulst et al. 2007). It occurs in a number of protected areas.Conservation Actions ProposedObtain more quantitative data on status, population trends and conservation requirements outside of Europe. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of current conservation action. In the EU, use a mixture of agri-environment schemes, direct payments to wader-friendly farmers (Musters et al. 2001) and large reserves to secure protection and appropriate management of breeding habitat; the coverage of agri-environment schemes in Europe should be increased (Kleijn et al. 2010) and increases in groundwater depth should be prioritised as an outcome (Verhulst et al. 2007). Establish nature reserves on important breeding sites throughout the species's range. Manage existing reserves appropriately: prescriptions include avoiding drainage of existing wet meadows, raising water tables where necessary, low-level use of organic fertiliser, low intensity grazing, late mowing, and prevention of succession to bushy vegetation; winter flooding is sometimes recommended but may reduce numbers of invertebrate prey (Gunnarsson et al. 2005). Ensure that migratory staging posts and winter feeding habitats and roosts are conserved and monitored, and knowledge of them is improved (Estrella and Masero 2010). Designate a Special Protection Area around Extremadura's rice fields, which is a key stopover site (Masero et al. 2011). Manage artificial habitats appropriately, e.g. maintain low water levels in salinas such so that they are available to foraging godwits (Estrella and Masero 2010), and block drainage to retain water in Iberian rice fields (Lourenço and Piersma 2008). Engage with governments and local people throughout its migration routes. Effectively enforce the EU-wide ban on hunting until there is clear evidence that the population has returned to a favourable conservation status. Safeguard habitats in Iberia, perhaps by offering support to rice producers (Gill et al. 2007). Collaborate with farmers and hunters, carrying out environmental education and outreach work where appropriate. Prevent afforestation of lowland breeding habitat in Iceland. Prevent a loss of key breeding areas due to abandonment of grasslands and meadows in eastern Europe. Monitor human disturbance as a threat. Ensure recognition as a protected animal throughout range (Hancock 2008).",,

On passage the species may frequent inland wetlands (Hayman et al. 1986), sandy beaches with pine Pinus spp. stands, swampy lowlands near lakes (Flint et al. 1984) and short-grass meadows, but during the winter it is more common in intertidal areas along muddy coastlines, estuaries, inlets, mangrove-fringed lagoons and sheltered bays (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) with tidal mudflats or sandbars (Johnsgard 1981). It breeds from late-May to August (Hayman et al. 1986). The nest is a depression positioned on a dry elevated site often between clumps of grass (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) or under a thicket (Flint et al. 1984). When breeding the species feeds on insects, annelid worms, molluscs and occasionally seeds and berries. At other times in intertidal areas the species's diet consists of annelids, bivalves and crustaceans, although it will also take cranefly larvae and earthworms on grasslands and occasionally larval amphibians and small fish.  This species is a full long-distance migrant (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). After breeding adults disperse to coastal moulting sites, then onwards to their wintering grounds. Birds breeding in Europe mainly winter in western Europe. Birds from the east only use wetlands in western Europe as stop-over sites on their way to Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The species is vulnerable due to concentration at a few wetlands in the non-breeding season (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is threatened by the degradation of foraging sites due to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Kelin and Qiang 2006) and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I and II.

Adequate protection and management of all important staging sites should be ensured, particularly in Germany and the Netherlands. Sustainable fisheries in the Wadden Sea and other important European estuaries should be promoted and the impacts of climate change in the high Arctic investigated.

It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) either in well-dispersed (Johnsgard 1981) solitary pairs (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) or in loose groups depending on the topography of the land (Snow and Perrins 1998). The autumn migration occurs from July onwards with the return passage to the breeding grounds occurring chiefly between March and May (Hayman et al. 1986). The species breeds on dry scrub heathland (Snow and Perrins 1998), moss and lichen tundra with stunted bushes, sedge meadows (Johnsgard 1981), wet moorland (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and mossy hummock bogs (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984) in open areas, river valleys, in birch forest near the Arctic treeline (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), along the shores of tundra lakes, burned areas of forest (Flint et al. 1984) and open montane forest in the boreal, subarctic and subalpine zones. On passage in the autumn and spring the species frequents wetlands, tidal flats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), short-sward wet and dry grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), farmland (Hayman et al. 1986) and heathland with Empetrum spp., generally occupying coastal habitats in the winter such as muddy, rocky or sandy beaches, tidal mudflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), sandflats (Urban et al. 1986), tidal marshes (Johnsgard 1981) and lagoons (Urban et al. 1986). When inland on migration and during the breeding season its diet consists of adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera, Orthoptera and cranefly larvae), spiders, millipedes, earthworms, snails, slugs, seeds, leaves and berries (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. of ericaceous plants) (Johnsgard 1981). On the coast during the winter the species takes crustaceans, molluscs, large polychaete worms and occasionally fish, reptiles or young birds. The nest is a shallow depression (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) often positioned on hummocks or in short heather or grass in dry exposed locations sometimes far from water (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984). When the breeding habitat (e.g. tundra or heathland) is flat and open the species nests in solitary pairs, but where irregular features such as hummocks and tall vegetation patches give more visual isolation the species may nest in loose groups (Snow and Perrins 1998).",The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive.Conservation Actions ProposedA study in the Shetland Islands, U.K. found that when trying to enhance the grazing quality of heathlands by re-seeding (e.g. with high quality grass-seed mixtures) it is better to apply lime, grass-seed and inorganic fertiliser directly to the surface of the ground rather than ploughing and harrowing the ground first, as the latter maintains more natural vegetation hummocks and heather used by the species for nesting (Grant 1992).

Along the coast it shows a preference for nesting on flat rock surfaces on inshore islands (Snow and Perrins 1998), open shingle and sandy beaches, dunes and spits (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), vegetated inter-dune areas, sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in estuaries (Gochfeld et al. 2013) and coastal lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998), saltmarshes (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), mainland peninsulas (Snow and Perrins 1998) and grassy plateauxs atop coastal cliffs (Gochfeld et al. 2013). Inland it may nest in similar habitats including sand or shingle lakes shores (Richards 1990), shingle banks in rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in lakes and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), sand- or gravel-pits (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes, ponds, grassy areas and patches of dredged soil (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds between April and June in solitary pairs or colonially in groups of up to several thousand pairs (inland colonies often smaller and more widely-dispersed than coastal ones). The nest is a shallow depression on open substrates with little or no vegetation placed near a vertical object (e.g. rock, shell, plant or artefact) to provide shelter for chicks and to facilitate nest identification. Nest sites include the edges of bare sand amongst vegetation, rocks or logs, open areas on the margins of vegetation on beaches, the edges of mats of vegetation in marshes, and grassy or rocky substrates on rocky islets. The species will also readily nest on artificial rafts. Clutches at higher latitudes are normally three eggs, however this is affected by food availability. It is an opportunistic feeder, its diet consisting predominantly of small fish and occasionally planktonic crustaceans and insects. This species is a strongly migratory coastal seabird (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013). Palearctic breeders migrate south after breeding between August and October, returning to the breeding grounds in March or April (Gochfeld et al. 2013).","During the breeding season the species is vulnerable to human disturbance at nesting colonies (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Blokpoel and Scharf 1991) (e.g. from off-road vehicles, recreation, motor-boats, personal watercraft and dogs) (van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Hyde 1997, Burger 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), and to the flooding of nest sites as a result of naturally fluctuating water levels (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2013). On its breeding grounds the species is also threatened by habitat loss as a result of coastal development (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2013), erosion (Hyde 1997), vegetation overgrowth (rapid vegetation succession encroaching upon nesting habitats) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Hyde 1997Gochfeld et al. 2013), and chemical pollution (which may also result in eggshell thinning) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2013). It suffers predation at nesting colonies from rats (especially on islands) (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Gochfeld et al. 2013) and from expanding populations of large gull species (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Gochfeld et al. 2013) such as Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) (Buckley and Buckley 1984) (gulls may also prevent the species from nesting in the area by colonising it first) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Gochfeld et al. 2013). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Other threats include organochlorine pollution, over-fishing by man (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and fatalities from wind turbine collisions (Everaert and Stienen 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayA conservation scheme for the protection of gull and tern breeding colonies in coastal lagoons and deltas (e.g. Po Delta, Italy) involves protection from human disturbance, prevention of erosion of islet complexes, habitat maintenance and the creation of new islets for nest sites (Fasola and Canova 1996).Conservation Actions ProposedIn the Po Delta of Italy a conservation scheme has specified that bare islets with 30–100 % cover of low vegetation (sward heights less than 20 cm) should be maintained or created as nesting sites (Fasola and Canova 1996). Artificial nesting rafts have proved effective in promoting breeding success in areas where there is a lack of suitable nesting habitat or where human disturbance is a particular threat (1996) (Gochfeld et al. 2013). Using fire to expose the ground surface in areas where vegetation succession is proceeding too far towards closed vegetation stages has been successful in some areas (Hyde 1997). Management techniques used to increase the breeding numbers and reproductive success of the species in the Great Lakes region of North America include creating artificial nesting sites, vegetation management, enhancement of existing nesting habitat, using models and vocalisation to attract breeding pairs and predator control (e.g. mammal-exclusion, destruction of gull nests, direct predator removal, or preventative measures against gull nesting) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991). Culling predatory gulls can be an effective management tool to enhance breeding productivity (Guillemette and Brousseau 2001), although some management plans recommend non-lethal harassment techniques that target gulls (e.g. egg and nest destruction, conspicuous human observers, gull displacement walks, and pyrotechnics) to reduce predation on nesting colonies rather than culling (Donehower et al. 2007).",,

It shows a preference for habitats with a vegetation cover of less than 40%, nesting on sand or shingle beaches, ridges (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and spits, rocky ground and small islands (Flint et al. 1984) in lakes and coastal lagoons (Gochfeld et al. 2014). It may also nest on islets or banks along rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), on swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and reed-covered flats (Flint et al. 1984), or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and sedge grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998) not far from water (Flint et al. 1984). The species also forages offshore, in ice-filled coastal bays or over wet tundra (Gochfeld et al. 2014). On passage it largely flies over open ocean (Snow and Perrins 1998) resting at sea on kelp, logs or flotsam, but may occur inland or along coastlines on beaches, reefs and spits (Higgins and Davies 1996). It breeds between May and July (although the exact timing varies with temperature and food availability) in solitary pairs or colonies of a few to several hundred pairs (usually 2–25). The nest is a shallow scrape (Gochfeld et al. 2014) in sand, shingle or turf (Richards 1990) on beaches, ridges and spits, rocky ground, small islands  in lakes, coastal lagoons (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and reed-covered flats (Flint et al. 1984), or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and sedge grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998) not far from water (Flint et al. 1984). It will also nest on artificial structures. Clutches are two to three eggs. Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans (especially planktonic species), molluscs, insects (e.g. caterpillars, Chironomidae) and earthworms. It will also take berries in the early spring on arrival on its breeding grounds but does not readily switch to other prey items when preferred prey supplies fail. The species is a very strong migrant and makes exceptional long-distance movements offshore or along western continental coastlines (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gochfeld et al. 2014) between its high Arctic breeding grounds and Antarctic wintering grounds (Gochfeld et al. 2014).","The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c.10° latitude from the polar edge of continent within  20–50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under a doubling of CO2 levels (Birdlife International, unpublished data). In many parts of Scandinavia, declines have been caused in the past by egg collecting, however this has decreased in recent years allowing the population to recover (Gochfeld et al. 2014). In some areas predation by Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (Horobin 1971) and American Mink (Mustela vison) can be a problem (Hagemeijer and Balir 1997) and mortality has been recorded as a result of red tide (Horobin 1971). In northern Britain the collapse of sand eel stocks have caused a crash in the population and in Svalbard the population may be vulnerable to oil, particularly in the post-breeding period (Gochfeld et al. 2014). Pollution is likely a major factor in the species's decline and yachting and other leisure activities have led to an increase in disturbance. Declines have also been correlated with gull abundance (Hagemijer and Blair 1997).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II.  In the Baltic Sea, removing feral American Mink (Neovison vison) from a large archipelago with many small islands resulted in an increase in the breeding density of this species in the area (Nordstrom et al. 2003). Conservation Actions ProposedGull control measures may also be practised successfully at some sites to reduce predation and displacement, especially when carried out in conjunction with the use of recordings and models to induce recolonistion of nesting terns (Buckley and Buckley 1984).

It breeds on barren or sparsely vegetated sandy, shell and rocky islands, shingle beaches, spits in estuaries and lakes, salt-marshes, salt-pans and rivers. Outside of the breeding season it frequents tidal creeks, coastal lagoons and salt-pans; sometimes feeds far out to sea (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). It feeds mainly on small fish and crustaceans, also insects, annelids and molluscs. The main fish species include sand eels (Ammodytes), roach (Rutilus rutilus), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus), carp (Cyprinus carpio), perch (Perca fluviatilis).

It is also highly vulnerable to human disturbance (including birdwatchers) at coastal and inland nesting sites which can lead to nest failures (Barcena et al. 1984, Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Pesticide pollution (e.g. organochlorine pollutants, mercury and DDT) (Barcena et al. 1984, Thyen et al. 2000, Choi et al. 2001) and artificially induced water-level fluctuations in saltmarshes (Barcena et al. 1984) may also pose a threat to the species's reproductive success (Barcena et al. 1984, Thyen et al. 2000, Choi et al. 2001).

It is on Annex II of the Bern Convention. Within the EU it is listed on Annex I of the Birds Directive. Protective measures such as fencing-off sensitive nesting areas, erecting warning signs and wardening are effective measures of increasing the breeding success of this species on sandy beaches (Richards 1990, Medeiros et al. 2007). There is also evidence that earlier breeders benefit more (i.e. have higher reproductive success) from protective measures, suggesting that conservation efforts can be maximised if concentrated earlier in the season (Medeiros et al. 2007). Breeding pairs are also known to be attracted to coastal locations where artificial nesting sites have been constructed (e.g. beaches of bare shingle and islands or rafts covered with sparse vegetation) (Burgess and Hirons 1992). A conservation scheme for the protection of gull and tern breeding colonies in coastal lagoons and deltas (e.g. Po Delta, Italy) involves protection from human disturbance, prevention of erosion of islet complexes, habitat maintenance and the creation of new islets for nest sites (Fasola and Canova 1996).

It frequents inland lakes, rivers, marshes, artificial fish-ponds and drainage-ponds covered with water-lilies (e.g. in Italy) (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), swamps, river pools, reservoirs, large dams, sewage-ponds, flooded saltmarshes (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996) and rice-fields. The species breeds from May to early-June (Richards 1990) in monospecific colonies of 10–100 pairs.The nest is a heap of aquatic vegetation or dry grass, placed either on floating and emergent vegetation over water 60–80 cm deep or resting on the bottom of very shallow water.

Its diet consists of terrestrial and aquatic insects (e.g. Dytiscidae, adult and larval Odonata, Orthoptera, flying ants (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) and mosquitoes (Richards 1990)), spiders, frogs, tadpoles, small crabs (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), shrimps (Richards 1990) and small fish. Northern breeding populations of this species are fully migratory (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). After breeding it departs for the wintering grounds from late-July to September, returning again between April and May (Richards 1990). The species sometimes forages singly, but is more common in small groups or larger mixed-species flocks on passage and in the winter (Snow and Perrins 1998).","This species suffers from the loss of natural wetlands to land reclamation, dry seasons and an increase in drainage schemes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), as well as the canalization of rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species suffers nest destruction from the invasive rodent species Myocastor coypus in Italy (Arduin 1997). Increasing tourism and water sports near breeding colonies result in disturbance and the loss of nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and many nests are lost to adverse weather. Fishermen collect eggs in Ukraine (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). It is affected by water quality and so pollution from insecticides and eutrophication are a threat (Martí and Moral 2004).

The species is gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998), foraging in small groups during the breeding season and congregating in large flocks offshore on passage and in the winter over shoals of predatory fish (Richards 1990, Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","On its breeding grounds the species is threatened by reductions in food availability due to the eutrophication of surface waters (which reduces the diversity of large insects), the acidification of lakes (which leads to the death of fish) (Beintema 1997) and pesticide pollution (which may also lead to direct mortality from poisoning) (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). When breeding the species is also threatened by fluctuating water levels (Snow and Perrins 1998), the loss and deterioration of freshwater nesting habitats (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, van der Winden 2005), e.g. through drainage for agriculture (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and overgrowth ofTypha spp. beds (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Linz and Blixt 1997), and human disturbance (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, van der Winden 2005), especially where this forces breeding pairs to leave the nest before the young are fully fledged (van der Winden 2002).Nests may be lost through storms and wave action (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). The intensification of fish farming has resulted on encroachment on water bodies, which has reduced the extent of floating vegetation and it suffers competition from other species (e.g. gulls, ducks or swans) which may be exacerbated by other threats (Tucker and Heath 1994).

It breeds mainly on steep sea cliffs and low, flat islands. During the winter it is mostly found offshore, along the edge of continental shelf and shallow banks, marine coasts and bays, usually in boreal waters but some birds occur in the cool subtropical zone. The time of breeding is variable and is largely determined by water temperature and ice. Generally egg-laying takes place mid-May to early June and fledging mostly by late July to mid-August. It lays on a broad or narrow cliff ledge and on low, flat islands; occasionally also in crevices, under boulders and in caves. It does not build a nest and lays a single egg on bare rock. It is a pursuit-diving marine bird which forages primarily during daylight (Wanless et al. 1988). During the breeding season, schooling pelagic fish species are the most important prey for adults, though benthic species can also be important. In Labrador, Canada, Shannies (Sicheaidae) were the main source of food, comprising 84% of the diet in 1996 and 52.9% in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). Capelin (Mallotus villosus) were also important, forming 44.7% of the diet in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). In the U.K., the main prey taxa are sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) and clupeids. Small gadoids are also important at some colonies. The species winters mostly within its breeding range with some birds remaining relatively sedentary (Nettleship et al. 2013).","This species is highly vulnerable to human disturbance as it is found in high concentrations outside the breeding season. Throughout the 19th and early 20thcenturies, egg collection and shooting at colonies, as well as introduced alien predators caused severe declines in the world population and unregulated hunting in Greenland is still a major threat.  As human populations increased and expanded the species was extirpated in many regions, particularly in the south of its range.Other important threats are overfishing of important forage species (e.g. capelin, herring, cod and sandeels) in the North Atlantic (Barents Sea, Iceland), uncontrolled gill-net fisheries in the north-east Atlantic and oil pollution and offshore petroleum developments in areas such as the Barents and North Seas and Greenland (Nettleship et al. 2013). The species is susceptible to avian cholera (Österblom et al. 2004) so is threatened by future outbreaks of this disease. Wind farm development has a negative impact on this species as well (Vanermen et al. 2014). The species is also likely threatened by future climate change (Sandvik 2005, Frederiksen et al. 2013).","Conservation Actions UnderwayUria aalge ibericus is found on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. With the implementation of bird protection laws, a slow recovery occurred over much of the Atlantic breeding range up to early 1970s except in north Norway and probably Iceland (Nettleship et al. 2013).Conservation Actions ProposedAt major colonies, detailed monitoring is needed, particularly in Iceland, where the status of the largest Atlantic population is poorly known (Nettleship et al. 2013). The impact of bycatch in fish nets can be reduced in several ways: Protecting areas on a seasonal and/or diurnal scale; concentrating salmon fisheries when salmon densities are high to improve fishing efficiency and catch to bycatch ratios; changing to an alternative fishing technique may reduce seabird mortality; and gear modification (Österblom et al 2002).",,

It breeds on coastal cliffs and islands, and is almost completely restricted to high and low Arctic zones with open water and adequate summer food supply (Nettleship and Christie 2013). It avoids extensive permanent pack-ice, breeding only in areas where vigorous vertical circulation creates open water supporting rich planktonic biomass near cliffed coasts (Snow and Perrins 1998). It winters mostly offshore to the edge of the continental shelf, and along sea coasts and in bays where concentrations of fish and invertebrates occur. At sea it is found in flocks which are often large, likely related to the non-random distribution of winter prey. Colony locations are usually associated with dynamic water systems, for example fronts, upwellings and converging currents where primary and secondary productivity is high. Arrival at breeding colonies and start of laying are variable and usually related to sea temperatures; towards the southern limit of low Arctic water and in northern boreal waters laying takes place late May to early June, in more northerly locations laying later in June or July. The species is highly colonial, usually in immense aggregations and at high densities on steep sea cliffs. The single egg is laid directly onto bare rock on narrow cliff ledges. It feeds on fish, squid and crustaceans throughout the year, supplemented by polychaetes and molluscs (Nettleship and Christie 2013). In low-Arctic Greenland and in the European sector of the polar basin, part of the population is present year round though some birds, notably immatures, move away in autumn (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds from west Greenland move south to east Newfoundland (shelf and Grand Banks) and Nova Scotia. Birds from the European Arctic move south-west towards west Greenland, including Spitsbergen birds that reach both south-west Greenland and Newfoundland waters (Nettleship and Christie 2013).","The species suffers from incidental kills in fishing nets, competition with commercial fisheries, notably in Barents Sea, Iceland and oil pollution and offshore oil developments in many areas (e.g,. Barents Sea, North Sea) (Nettleship and Christie 2013). It is also likely to be affected by climate change (Gaston et al. 2005).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThere are no known current conservation measures for this species.Conservation Actions ProposedThere are a number of immediate conservation requirements for this species. Enhanced monitoring of major colonies is needed, particularly in Iceland, Spitsbergen and the Russian Arctic, where population size and status are inadequately known. Detailed assessment of impacts of overfishing by commercial fisheries is required, particularly of capelin, cod, herring and sand eels in the Barents Sea and Iceland. Continue and expand assessments of by-catch in gill-net fisheries, particularly in the NE Atlantic. Tighter legislation and penalties (national and international) associated with oil pollution from offshore developments and transport, as well as expansion and refinement of monitoring schemes to assess bird mortality should be developed. The eradication of alien predators, especially foxes at Russian colonies should be undertaken (Nettleship and Christie 2013).",,

The population in the EU27 is estimated at 279,000-295,000 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","The species lives on rocky sea coasts, breeding on cliff ledges and under boulders. Northern populations migrate outside the breeding season, while southern ones are both migratory as far as the Mediterranean (mainly immatures) and dispersive (adults). Iceland holds over two-thirds of the European total, followed in importance by the U.K. and Norway, these three countries together supporting over 90% of the European population (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is a pursuit diver that propels itself through the water with its wings. They are capable of diving to 120 m depth, but mostly forage nearer the surface. They spend most of their lives at sea, only arriving ashore to reproduce. They are known to consume Krill, Sprat (Sprattus sprattus), Sandeels (Ammondytes spp.) and Capelin amongst other prey (Nettleship 1996).","This species is threatened by the current and future impacts of climate change, including temperature extremes, sea temperature rises and shifts and reductions in prey availability (Sandvik et al. 2005). The species is vulnerable to extreme weather, with severe winter storms causing large scale mortality across north-western Europe in the past (Underwood & Stowe 1984). As a pursuit diver the species is at risk from being caught in gillnets and driftnets, with gillnet fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas known to catch significant numbers (Zydelis et al. 2009, 2013; Skov et al. 2011). As the species spends much of its life at sea, including at and below the sea surface, it is vulnerable to both chronic oil pollution and oil spill events. Offshore renewable energy, such as wind farms are also likely to pose a threat to this species, including through habitat displacement (Furness et al. 2013) and collision, although collision risk is currently considered low (Bradbury et al. 2014). Disturbance from shipping lanes and marine constructions occurs in coastal and offshore areas with high human presence, and habitat degradation at sea from mining and aggregate extraction also threatens this species. On land during its breeding season this species is exposed to invasive mammalian predators (e.g. rats, cats, mink), which could increase in severity as climate change allows their northward movement. The species is also vulnerable to disturbance from recreational and tourism activities. It is hunted in the Faroe Islands (Thorup et al. 2014).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement.

In the summer and autumn (May–November) its habitat use is more conservative, and birds utilise bare ground, vegetation less than 2 m high and also forest margins. Exotic vegetation such as plantations of Japanese red cedar Cryptomeria japonica within 200 m of native forest is also used during summer (Ceia et al. 2009). Birds breed from mid-June to late August, with a clutch size of three eggs (Teodósio et al. 2009).

This species is resident but movements of up to 5.8 km between native forest patches have been recorded as birds move to feed on ripening seeds (Ceia 2008).","The historical decline and its extremely small range are believed to be a consequence of the widespread clearance of native forest for forestry plantations and agriculture. The spread of alien invasive plant species (especially Hedychium gardnerianum, Clethra arborea and Pittosporum undulatum), which have largely overrun the remaining patches of natural vegetation, suppress the natural fruit, seed and bud food supply to the species (G. Hilton in litt. 2006). The species exhibits a preference for non-invaded laurel forest habitat (Ceia et al. 2011), and is entirely absent from highly invaded areas (e.g. P. undulatum copses (Ceia et al. 2009)). Food shortages are potentially a problem throughout the year, but are most severe in late winter (Ceia et al. 2011b). Random environmental and demographic factors can affect such small populations and inbreeding may reduce reproductive output.

The species can occur op to 2,100 m Asl. The species is completely migratory in the northern part of its breeding range; elsewhere it is partially migratory or sedentary. During winter it gathers in flocks, often in farmland on stubble fields or other weedy habitats (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). Normally the breeding season starts in April and late broods may even be started in September. The nest is built by the female. It is placed on the ground, often in field boundaries or ditches, well hidden among the vegetation, or in hedges or isolated bushes. The clutch, usually three to five eggs, is normally incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after 12–14 days. They are brooded by the female, the male delivering food. The nestling period is 11–13 days (Bradbury et al. 2000, Copete 2011). The species mainly takes seeds and other plant materials from a variety of tree, herb and grass species. During the breeding season it shifts to invertebrates, which it feeds to nestlings (Copete 2011).","The population is suspected to be in decline owing to a reduction in cultivation of cereal crops and the intensification of farmland management. Agricultural efficiency measures such as removal of hedgerows, filling or clearing of ditches and grazing or ploughing right up to the field edge are likely to have adversely affected the species (Bradbury et al. 2000, BirdLife International 2015). Furthermore the species suffers indirectly from the use of insecticides and herbicides, as these reduce the abundance of arthropods and the availability of weedy patches rich in seeds (Perkins et al. 2002, Morris 2005, Hart et al. 2006). The species interbreeds with Emberiza leucocephalos in the contact zone of both species in the most western part of its range. According to Panov et al.

Intensive research into the causes of the decline of the small British population of the species in the past revealed a complex of factors affecting the population: loss of winter food due to the shift from spring- to winter-sown crops, the general loss of arable cropping in grass-dominated landscapes; the loss of large insect food for chicks in the breeding season due to the intensification of grassland management; and the loss of suitable nest sites due to the removal of hedges and unsympathetic management of those that remained (Evans 1997, Evans et al. 1997).

On passage to its wintering grounds the majority of the species travels overland on a broad front, although there is also an important route down the west coast of Europe (Smit and Piersma 1989, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During the breeding season this species inhabits lowland and upland (but not montane) regions, in wooded and open tundra (Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes, swampy pine or birch forest near the arctic tree-line, and also more open areas such as heathland and shrub tundra (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During migration and on its wintering grounds (Flint et al. 1984) this species frequents a variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands such as sewage farms, irrigated rice fields, brackish lagoons, salt-marshes, salt-pans, sheltered muddy coastal shores (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), marshes and marshy lake edges (Johnsgard 1981, Urban et al. 1986), small reservoirs, pools and flooded grasslands (Urban et al. 1986).

For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","Most populations of this species are fully migratory and travel on a broad front over land and along coasts, some Icelandic and western European populations remaining close to their breeding grounds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It breeds from March to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs or in loose colonies (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), departing the breeding grounds from June to October, and returning from the wintering grounds again between February and April (Hayman et al. 1986). The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, inland wet grasslands with short swards (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (including cultivated meadows) (Johnsgard 1981), grassy marshes, swampy heathlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and swampy moors (Johnsgard 1981). On passage the species may frequent inland flooded grasslands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and the silty shores of rivers and lakes (Flint et al. 1984), but during the winter it is largely coastal, occupying rocky, muddy and sandy beaches, saltmarshes, tidal mudflats, saline and freshwater coastal lagoons (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), tidal estuaries (Johnsgard 1981), saltworks and sewage farms. When breeding it feeds on insects, spiders and annelid worms. During the non-breeding season the species takes insects, spiders and annelid worms, as well as molluscs, crustaceans (especially amphipods e.g. Corophium spp.) and occasionally small fish and tadpoles (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is a shallow scrape or hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) on a hummock or at the base of a tuft (Flint et al. 1984) of grass, often well hidden by overhanging leaves (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species usually nests solitarily inland (less than 10 pairs/km2) but in loosely colonial groups (up to 100–300 pairs/km2) on the coast (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).","The species is threatened by the loss of breeding and wintering habitats through agricultural intensification, wetland drainage, flood control, afforestation, land reclamation, industrial development (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), encroachment of Spartina spp. on mudflats (Evans 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), improvement of marginal grasslands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. by drainage, inorganic fertilising and re-seeding) (Baines 1988), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), and heavy grazing (e.g., of saltmarshes) (Norris et al. 1998). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (U.K.) (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton et al. 2002b). It is vulnerable to severe cold periods on its western European wintering grounds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and suffers from nest predation by introduced predators (e.g. European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus)) on some islands (Jackson 2001). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive. The EU commisioned a Management Plan for this huntable bird species considered to be in unfavourable status (Technical Report - 2009 - 031) (Jensen et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedOptimal breeding conditions for this species may be provided by creating a mosaic of unflooded grassland, winter-flooded grassland and shallow pools (Ausden et al. 2002). Winter flooding of grasslands is beneficial to the species as it helps to keep the sward height short and open and also creates pools which provide a source of aquatic invertebrates in the spring (Ausden et al. 2002, Olsen and Schmidt 2004). Such shallow pools on coastal grazing marshes should be maintained until the end of June (Ausden et al. 2003). The number of breeding pairs on improved grassland was successfully increased on a reserve in Wales by the implementation of a two-year rotation of chisel ploughing, as well as a seasonal sheep and cattle grazing regime and a controlled increase in the water-level (Squires and Allcorn 2006). At Lower Lough Erne in Northern Ireland the breeding population of the species increased considerably as a result of cutting rush beds in mid-winter (although the species nested on uncut areas, chicks benefited from the presence of adjacent short, open areas for feeding) (Robson and Allcorn 2006). Low-level grazing of salt marshes (e.g. c. 1 cow per hectare) does not appear to affect the species and may even be beneficial to breeding populations (Norris et al. 1997, Ausden et al. 2005), although cattle should not be put onto the marsh until towards the end of the nesting season (e.g. late-May or early-June) to minimise the risk of nest trampling (Norris et al. 1997). There is also evidence that too heavy grazing can be detrimental (Evans 1986). The species is known to show increased hatching success when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001), and in the U.K. there is evidence that the removal of Spartina anglica from tidal mudflats using a herbicide is beneficial for the species (Evans 1986).",,

The Wadden Sea for example is used by many Fennoscandian birds as a stop-over and moulting site from late April to mid-May. Most Palearctic birds are trans-Saharan migrants (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), the main autumn passage through northern and temperate Europe occurring from the second week of July to late October (Snow and Perrins 1998). Flocks arrive in southern Africa and Australia from August to September, and depart again in March for the northward return migration (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species breeds in the boreal forest zone from sea level to 1,200 m in Norway (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) (although predominantly up to 450 m) (Snow and Perrins 1998), in swampy forest clearings, woody moorland, open bogs and marshes (including raised and blanket bogs) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and eutrophic lakes with margins of dead and decaying vegetation (Johnsgard 1981).

The adults start to move away from the breeding grounds in late June, with juveniles following in late August, arriving in tropical Africa from late July through August to October. Spring departure from the wintering grounds begins in late March to early April, with breeding areas starting to be reoccupied from late April (early June in northern Russia) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and with breeding occurring between May and mid July (Van Gils et al. 2013).

Small numbers may also remain in the northern maritime climatic zone (e.g. the British Isles and Mediterranean) throughout the year (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The European population that overwinters in West Africa migrates south between mid-July and August (juveniles following one month later, and returns to the breeding grounds from late March to April (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Immature individuals may also remain in the winter range throughout the summer breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds from May to June in scattered single pairs 60?70 m apart in optimal breeding habitat, and migrates singly or in small flocks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), although it usually remains solitary in its winter range (Urban et al. 1986). It forages diurnally (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and may aggregate at night (Johnsgard 1981) into roosts of over 100 individuals (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During the breeding season this species shows a preference for pebbly, sandy or rocky margins of fast-flowing rivers (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), as well as small ponds, pools (Snow and Perrins 1998) and dams (Urban et al. 1986), clear freshwater lake shores, sheltered sea coasts with rocky or sandy beaches, tidal creeks and estuaries (Urban et al. 1986), and often forages in patches of dry meadow (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In its winter range this species inhabits a wide variety of habitats, such as small pools, ditches, riverbanks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), streams, dam shores (Yalden 1992), marshy areas (Johnsgard 1981), estuaries, freshwater seeps on coastal shores and saltmarshes, harbours, docks (Yalden 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and filtration tanks of sewage works (Yalden 1992). It will also forage on grassland along roadsides and occasionally in gardens (Yalden 1992, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), but it generally avoids large coastal mudflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The diet of this species consists of adult and larval insects (such as beetles and Diptera), spiders, molluscs, snails, crustaceans, annelids, and occasionally frogs, toads, tadpoles and small fish, as well as plant material (including seeds) (Urban et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).

Outside of the breeding season the species is strictly coastal, frequenting tidal mudflats or sandflats, sandy beaches of sheltered coasts, rocky shelves, bays, lagoons and harbours, occasionally also oceanic beaches and saltmarshes. During the breeding season the species's diet consists predominantly of insects (mainly adult and larval Diptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and bees) as well as spiders, small crustaceans, snails and worms (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). When it first arrives on the breeding grounds however, the species is dependant upon vegetation (including the seeds of sedges, horsetails (Equisetum spp.) and grass shoots) owing to the initial lack of insect prey (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season the species takes intertidal invertebrates such as bivalve and gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. horseshoe crab (Limulus spp.) eggs) (Karpanty et al. 2006), annelid worms and insects, rarely also taking fish and seeds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).

The species usually occurs in small flocks on migration (Johnsgard 1981) although it may aggregate into larger flocks at stopover sites (Hayman et al. 1986), and in winter it forages in small to very large flocks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species breeds in the high Arctic on barren, stony tundra with well-drained ridges (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), gentle slopes or level alluvial plains supporting scattered vegetation of willow Salix spp., Dryas spp. and saxifrage Saxifraga spp. usually less than 200 m above sea-level (Johnsgard 1981).

During the breeding season this species inhabits low altitude tundra in the high Arctic (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (although it exceptionally occurs above 1,000 m in the west of its range) (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for dry ground among dwarf willows near swampy areas or saltmarshes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), or areas where mosses and sedges are interspersed with hummocks covered by Empetrum (Johnsgard 1981). It avoids areas where annual rainfall exceeds 250 mm (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).

It is mainly found near coastal inlets, fjords, deltas, rivers or streams from sea level to 250 m, but also occurs up to 1,200 m inland (Snow and Perrins 1998) on flat, clear ground with little vegetation, areas covered with short grass and interspersed with patches of scrub (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), areas with grasses, sedges or Empetrum, and scrub willow or birch thickets with sandy or gravelly stretches (Johnsgard 1981). Both dry and wet areas are used, but habitats with elevated locations such as boulders or buildings are preferred because of their use as song perches (Johnsgard 1981).

The species breeds on Arctic coasts (Hayman et al. 1986) and in upland areas (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, Hayman et al. 1986), nesting close to the fringes of snow and ice, on wet moss or barren rocky tundra with patches of lichen and Dryas spp., on rocky islands and islets or on shingle beaches (Van Gils et al. 2013). It forages on dry tundra or along the moist margins of ponds, at the edges of melting snow-drifts and in areas of thick moss (Hayman et al. 1986). During the winter and on passage the species shows a preference for tidal rocky shores with strong wave action (Hayman et al. 1986) and suitable high-tide roosting areas (Van Gils et al. 2013), often utilising artificial structures such as concrete sea defences and breakwaters (Hayman et al. 1986). In some northern areas (e.g. Svalbard) the species frequents mudflats, shingle beaches and coastal lagoons before and after breeding but before migrating south (Van Gils et al. 2013). During the breeding season its diet consists largely of insects (e.g., adult, larval and pupal Diptera, Ichneumon wasps and aphids) and Collembola (springtails), as well as spiders, gastropods, annelid worms and some plant material (e.g. leaves, buds, berries and seeds) (Van Gils et al. 2013). On the coast the species feeds predominantly upon molluscs (especially gastropods Littorina spp. and mussels Mytilus spp.) as well as insects (e.g. beetles and Diptera), small crustaceans (e.g. amphipods), annelid worms (Van Gils et al. 2013), small fish (Johnsgard 1981) and algae (Enteromorpha spp.). The nest is a small scrape positioned in the open on tundra moss (Van Gils et al. 2013), in hummocky tundra (Flint et al. 1984) close to tufts of Dryas spp. or Arctostaphylos spp. (Johnsgard 1981), or in rocky or pebbly areas between cliffs (Flint et al. 1984).",The species is likely to be affected by climate change (Rehfisch et al. 2004). It is also vulnerable to disturbance (Burton et al. 1996).,Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex II of the Bern Convention.Conservation Actions ProposedThe species must be protected from disturbance by humans.,,

The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey et al. 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).","This species is significantly threatened by the loss of its breeding habitat though afforestation of moorland (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Lavers and Haines-Young 1997). It may also suffer from nest predation by introduced mammals (e.g. European hedgehog Erinaceus europeaus) on some islands (Jackson 2001). In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass Spartina anglica which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton et al. 2002b). Important migratory stop-over habitats on the Baltic Sea coastline adjacent to the Kaliningrad region of Russia are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, peat-extraction, reedbed mowing and burning, and abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1 in particular) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive and Annex II of the Bern Convention.Conservation Actions ProposedThe provision of well-surfaced paths in breeding areas that receive> 30 visitors a day has been shown to reduce the impact of human disturbance on this species's reproductive performance (Pearce-Higgins et al. 2007).

On migration, the species crosses Europe in July, reaching Africa from mid-July to September. The return migration to the breeding grounds begins late-April to May, with arrival in the Arctic beginning in early June, and breeding stretching from June to July. Many 1st-year birds remain on the wintering grounds, and non-breeding adults remain just south of the breeding grounds in central Siberia during the summer (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species is gregarious outside of the breeding season, occurring in small parties or larger flocks of up to several hundreds on the coast, but usually in smaller numbers inland (although gatherings of hundreds can occur locally on passage) (Urban et al. 1986). It forages both diurnally and nocturnally (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species breeds on slightly elevated areas in the lowlands of the high Arctic (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) especially on southward-facing slopes (Johnsgard 1981), as well as along the coast and islands of the Arctic Ocean (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It shows a preference for open tundra with marshy, boggy depressions and pools (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) from melting permafrost and snow (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of insects, such as the adults, pupae and larvae of Diptera (e.g. midges, craneflies (Johnsgard 1981)) and beetles, as well as bugs and leeches (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the winter its diet consists of polychaete worms, molluscs, crustaceans (such as amphipods, brine shrimps and copepods), and occasionally insects and seeds. The nest is a cup positioned on the margins of marshes or pools, on the slopes of hummock tundra, or on dry patches in Polygonum tundra (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).","This species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.

Adults breeding in Fennoscandia leave the breeding grounds in July (juveniles departing in August), and stop-over in substantial numbers in Sivash, southern Ukraine, on the Middle Eastern coasts, Caspian Sea and Bulgarian seaboard, before arriving in wintering grounds in Africa, Pakistan and south India between August and early-October (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). A few non-breeding birds also remain at the wintering sites during the summer. Breeding occurs in early- to late-June in Fennoscandia, and between mid-June and early July in Russia, pairs nesting in loose colonies of 2–10 nests, usually spaced 80–100 m apart. The species migrates singly or in small groups, although during the spring migration flocks of up to several hundred can occur (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species breeds in the wettest parts of bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and on open peatland; the Scandinavian and north-west Russian populations breeding in the subarctic montane and lowland zones above 200 m (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (around 1,000 m in Norway) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and the Siberian population breeding in wet Arctic tundra (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).

The European population migrates across the Sahara Desert between late-July and early September (leaving breeding grounds June to mid-July) to reach wintering grounds in tropical Africa from late-August onwards. These populations return to their breeding grounds from mid-March, where they breed April-June (Europe) (Wiersma et al. 2013). This species is mainly solitary throughout the non-breeding season and on migration, occasionally occurring in flocks of not more than 10 individuals (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013). It also breeds singly or in loose neighbourhood groups spaced 7–200 m apart (Wiersma et al. 2013).

This species may also utilise temporary artificial habitats such as gravel pits (Ratcliffe 1974, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma et al. 2013), sewage works, industrial wastelands (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma et al. 2013) and refuse tips (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986), and may use open arable land on clay soil in exceptional circumstances (Johnsgard, 1981). The species prefers lowland habitats and is rarely found above 800 m in Europe (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma et al. 2013). The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting mainly of insects such as beetles, flies (especially larvae and pupae), ants, bugs, mayfly and dragonfly larvae, caddisflies, crickets and larval Lepidoptera, as well as spiders, freshwater shrimps and other small crustaceans, mussels, worms and snails (Johnsgard, 1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013). Vegetation (such as the seeds of grasses, sedges, Polygonum and Compositae) is taken rarely and is likely to be ingested incidentally along with animal matter (Cramp and Simmons 1983). The nest is a shallow scrape on loose sand, dry mud or on flat, bare rocks surrounded by mud or sand (Johnsgard, 1981, Urban et al. 1986), sometimes amongst sparse vegetation (Grimmett et al. 1998, Wiersma et al. 2013) in the vicinity of water, and often on small islands (Wiersma et al. 2013) or adjacent farmland (Hayman et al. 1986).

Cause for recent declines in Europe might be heavy persecution in North Africa; amelioration of climate in breeding area may also be significant factor.  Species has appeared incapable of truly colonizing northern England as a breeding bird, despite availability of seemingly suitable habitat, presumably due to number of sheep, degree of recreational use and increasing acidification of soils. Wintering populations poorly known. Numbers declined in Britain in late 19th century due to hunting and egg-collecting (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

It will also breed on grassy moors, swampy heaths, bogs (Johnsgard 1981) and arable fields. During the winter the species utilises large open pastures and arable fields for roosting and forages on stubble, ploughed fields (Wiersma 1996). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs (Wiersma 1996) although pairs may also nest close together in optimal habitat (Johnsgard 1981). Males perform a dazzling aerial song flight display, during which the wingtips produce a droning sound. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with some plant material in short grassy vegetation. Clutch size is typically four eggs but may be only two or three. Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, ants, Diptera, crickets (Wiersma 1996), grasshoppers, dragonflies, mayflies, cicadas and Lepidoptera) (Urban et al. 1986), spiders, snails and earthworms (Wiersma 1996). Most populations of this species are fully migratory (Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and travel on a broad front out of Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998) although some breeding populations in more temperate regions are sedentary (Wiersma 1996).","This species suffered past declines as a result of land-use intensification and this is still a problem. Wetland drainage and egg collecting have previously threatened the species too (Wiersma 1996). Today it is threatened by reduced breeding productivity as a result of intensifying and changing agricultural practices (Schekkerman et al. 2009), especially the improvement of grasslands (e.g. by drainage, inorganic fertilising and reseeding) (Baldi et al. 2005) and loss of field margins and semi-natural habitat. Important migratory stop-over habitats for this species on the Baltic Sea coastline are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, land abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). Clutch destruction may also occur during spring cultivation (using machinery) on arable fields (Wiersma 1996). The species is susceptible to avian botulism so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Hubalek et al. 2005), and suffers from nest predation from corvids and mammalian predators including introduced mammals on some islands (Jackson 2001) and an increasing number of predators in formerly open and predator-hostile agricultural landscapes (Schekkerman et al. 2009).

Nesting occurs in cliffs or crags, occasionally in trees and it sometimes occupies the old nest of another raptor. Birds usually form monogamous pairs but occasionally polyandrous trios too. Both sexes construct a nest of sticks with a deep central cup, which is usually heavily lined with a range of materials including wool, hair, rags and the remains of food, even excrement, although sometimes scarcely lined at all. Clutches vary from one to three eggs, although normally two (Orta et al. 2013). It has a broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and faeces. It is usually solitary, but will congregate at feeding sites, such as rubbish tips, or vulture restaurants (i.e. supplementary feeding stations). It also scavenges at human settlements, and forms roosts of non-breeding birds (Ceballos & Donázar 1990). This species is migratory and most European birds will winter in sub-Saharan Africa between 14° and 17°N although a few winter in Spain (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","This species faces a number of threats across its range. Disturbance, lead poisoning (from gun shot), direct poisoning, electrocution (by powerlines), collisions with wind turbines, reduced food availability and habitat change are currently impacting upon European populations (Donázar et al. 2002, N. Petkov in litt. 2005, Kurtev et al. 2008, Zuberogoitia et al. 2008, Carrete et al. 2009, Dzhamirzoev and Bukreev 2009, Sara et al. 2009, Angelov et al. in prep. 2011). Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009) and the Balkans (I. Angelov in. litt. 2012). Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional muladares in Spain and Portugal (Donázar 2004, J. C. Atienza in litt. 2007, Lemus et al. 2008, Donázar et al. 2009, Cortás-Avizanda et al. 2010, Donázar et al. 2010a, Cortés-Avizanda 2011); however, recently-passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers (A. Brunner in litt. 2010). Poisoning is a threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete et al. 2007, Carrete et al. 2009, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2009), and through the consumption of inappropriately disposed of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries such as Spain (Lemus et al. 2008) and Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted high levels of contamination of the species leading to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease (Lemus et al. 2008) (e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria (Kurtev et al. 2008)). It appears that Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2007 news (www.birdlife.org/news)), is driving the recent rapid declines in India (Cuthbert et al. 2006, A. Rahmani in litt. 2012). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects (BirdLife International 2007 news (www.birdlife.org/news)). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by Gyps spp. vultures (Cuthbert et al. 2006). Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donazar et al. 2002, Donazar et al. 2007a) and  potentially risky in other regions of Spain (Donazar et al. 2007b, 2010b). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) may reduce breeding success in the short-term (Kurtev et al. 2008).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. Occurs within a number of protected areas across its range. Monitoring programmes, supplementary feeding (Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2010) and campaigns against illegal use of poisons, including awareness-raising, are in place for a number of national populations. An International Species Action Plan for the species was published in 2008 (Iñigo et al. 2008). National species action plans are in place in France, Bulgaria and Italy, and the species is included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP). Efforts are being taken to release captive-bred individuals in parts of Italy. In Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria and Macedonia birds have been fitted with satellite tags to study juvenile dispersion, migratory movements and wintering areas (e.g. García-Ripollés et al. 2010). Nest guarding schemes for pairs that are most threatened by poachers have been implemented in Italy and Bulgaria, where very small populations survive. Expeditions to study the limiting factors in the wintering areas and along the migration flyway have taken place together with local organizations in Turkey and other, non-European countries.Conservation Actions ProposedStart and maintain intensive cooperation with local key stakeholders to ensure poison- and poaching-free zones at sites with high densities or congregations of the species throughout the breeding and migration, alongside similar efforts for other threatened species. Build capacity in countries along the migration flyways. Research the causes and extent of current declines across the species's range. Insulate dangerous electricity pylons in areas where high mortality is recorded. Coordinate monitoring to assess trends throughout the range. Relax the European Union animal hygiene regulations in relation to necrophagous birds. Establish supplementary feeding sites where appropriate, especially at sites where congregations of non-breeders can be supported. Effectively reduce risks of poisoning through strict enforcement of poison-bait ban and education. Lobby for the banning of Diclofenac for veterinary purposes throughout the species's range, and support the enforcement of this ban where it has been adopted. Where applicable, establish the impact of wind turbines, and lobby for effective impact assessments to be carried out prior to their construction. Where appropriate, reduce disturbance by guarding nests. Confiscate illegally-kept live birds and use them for the purposes of captive breeding and future restocking and reintroduction programs. In key areas of the species's range, implement long-term and large-scale education and community involvement programmes.",,

It relies heavily on soaring flight, and has been shown to fly at altitudes of 10,000 m and higher. Birds hunt alone but congregate at food sources and roosts; they also tend to migrate singly, but concentrations (usually up to 15 individuals) form at sea crossings and strong thermals (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). It is a species of expansive open areas in a wide array of environments, from mountains to semi-desert, and is recorded regularly from sea level up to c. 2,750 m. It feeds almost exclusively on carrion, mainly that of large mammals. The nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred and it is a thin, fairly small platform of branches, sometimes stolen from other large raptors. A single egg is laid (Orta et al. 2015).","It declined markedly throughout the 19th–20th centuries in much of Europe, mainly due to direct persecution and ""bycatch"" from the poisoned carcasses set for livestock predators (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). In some areas a reduction in available food supplies, arising from changes in livestock management practices, also had an impact (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I. CMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. Five successful reintroductions have occurred in France (Global Raptor Information Network 2015) including in 1981 in the Massif Central as well as in Drôme and Provence (Orta et al. 2015). Additional reintroduction projects have led to the establishment of colonies in Italy, Spain and Austria. During the 1980s, in Serbia, the species benefited from winter feeding stations (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Increases in recent decades have also been due to the banning of poisoning of carcasses (Le Gouaret al. 2008). European laws prohibiting farmers from leaving dead animals on their land have also been rescinded, benefiting this species (Global Raptor Information Network 2015).Conservation Actions ProposedNon-intensive livestock management systems, such as pastoralism, should be maintained and promoted to ensure a food supply for this species; the provision of feeding stations is also beneficial, particularly when food is scarce. Large and continuous areas of afforestation should be avoided to maintain the large areas of habitat needed for foraging (Tucker and Heath 1994).

Two different eco-geographical categories occur in Europe: lowland sierras covered by dense Mediterranean maquis (Spain and Greece) and sub alpine forests (Spain) (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, including forest, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands (Batbayar et al. 2006).Egg-laying occurs February to April, often in loose colonies or nuclei. It builds a very large (145–190 cm wide, 95–300 cm deep) stick nest, mainly in evergreen oak (Quercus) or pine (Pinus) in Spain and in Armenia and Azerbaijan mainly in juniper (Juniperus). Nesting on rock is extremely rare in Europe. Clutch size is typically one egg (Meyburg and Christie 2014). Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken (Batbayar et al. 2006). The species is largely resident although some small scale dispersive movements occur in Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination (Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs (Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar in litt. 2005). There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several Gyps vultures in India, may have a negative impact on this species (N. Batbayar in litt. 2005). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested (Lemus et al. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, and deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacterial flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections (Lemus et al. 2008). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal (Anon. 2004b); however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers (A. Brunner in litt. 2010). In eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady in litt. 2007). Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. Habitat loss is also thought to be important (Anon. 2004). Outside of Europe, the majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar et al. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species.","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. A European Action Plan for the species was published in 1996 (Heredia 1996). The EU Birds Directive has contributed to the recovery and conservation of the species in Europe, particularly Spain, where the population increased from an estimated 290 pairs in 1984 to a minimum of 1,845 pairs in 2006 (De la Puente et al. 2007). Co-operation between Spanish government agencies and conservationists under the 'Antidote Programme' also appears to have been effective in mitigating the effects of poisoned baits. Both the Spanish and the Andalusian Governments have produced anti-poisoning strategies, but the former still remain to be financially supported while the latter need more decisive official endorsement. A reintroduction project in Grands Causses, southern France has resulted in the establishment of a small breeding population (16 pairs were breeding in 2006 (Eliotout et al. 2007)) with good prospects. Supplementary feeding programmes have been initiated in Spain and France to provide a safe, poison-free food source, although there are concerns that the species may be not very prone to feeding at conventional feeding stations. Captive breeding populations have also been established (Tewes et al.1998).  In the Balkans, the species has only one stable colony in the Dadia forest reserve in northern Greece, where WWF has long been involved. Supplementary food is also provided in Bulgaria for breeding birds (Anon. 2007). In eastern Europe, fewer conservation actions are known, although the species occurs within a number of protected areas in the region. The Balkan Vulture Action Plan aims to transfer expertise and technology relating to the conservation of the species from western to eastern parts of Europe (Anon. 2004b). Conservation Actions ProposedSurvey to determine the species's status and population trends on breeding grounds outside Europe and on wintering grounds (Anon. 2004b).

Hundreds of birds occasionally gather at roosting sites, sometimes with other harriers such as C. pygargus, but otherwise they are usually solitary, associating only temporarily at especially rich feeding sites (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). They have a slightly greater tendency to be gregarious while on migration but the above still generally applies. Birds fly c.10–30 m above the ground (Brown et al. 1982). The species inhabits extensive areas of dense marsh vegetation, in fresh or brackish water, generally in lowlands (Orta et al. 2014), up to 400 m (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is a generalist predator taking a variety of prey types, with small birds generally preferred but mammals such as voles, rabbits and rats being more important in parts of its range. The nest is a pile of reeds built in dense marsh vegetation. Typically lays three to six eggs (Orta et al. 2014).","Major threats include wetland desiccation and drainage; persecution by shooting; pollution, especially from excessive pesticide use in and around wetlands, and poisoning by heavy metals, notably the consumption of lead-shot through feeding on contaminated waterbirds (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). The historical threat of hunting in southern Europe has mostly subsided, but illegal shooting is still rife locally, notably on Malta (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is also highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. The widespread ban of persistent pesticides has allowed the recovery of populations in some areas (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Orta et al. 2014). In the Netherlands, parts of the Ijsselmeer have been reclaimed, providing huge reedbeds and thus breeding and feeding habitat for the species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The use of lead shot has been completely banned in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway and partial bans are in place in many other countries (AEWA 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedConservation of this species’s wetland habitat is most important; existing wetlands should be legally protected and degraded wetlands restored. In agricultural areas, an unharvested area should be left around active nests of 30 m x 30 m until the chicks have fledged (Mebs and Schmidt 2006).

It evidently avoids very dry open sites and selects wetter areas for nesting, preferably with sparse shrubs and weeds (Tucker and Heath 1994). It will nest above 1,000 m in the Caucasus (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species returns to its breeding grounds in March and April and nests in loose colonies. The nest consists of a pile of grass placed on the ground and protected by vegetation. Clutch size can be from three to six eggs but usually four or five (Orta and Christie 2015). Birds fly at c. 1.9 m above the ground when hunting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Christie 2015). The principal prey is small rodents (mostly voles and mice), lizards, and small birds, especially fledglings but it is also quite capable of taking larks and other passerines, in flight as well as on the ground (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory, with most birds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa or south-east Asia. They leave their breeding grounds between August and November and return in March and April (Orta and Christie 2015). Birds migrate on a broad front, with only minor concentrations at bottleneck sites (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Christie 2015).

It leaves its breeding grounds in August and September, beginning their return in March and April (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta et al. 2014). Birds tend to migrate on broad fronts, but there are concentrations in Gibraltar and along the Rift Valley (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). Nevertheless it will readily migrate over expanses of water (Brown et al. 1982). Birds tend to hunt alone, although they do gather at high prey concentrations and will roost in groups of often over 50, sometimes communally with C. macrourus and C. aeruginosus (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is a bird of open country, usually in lowlands. Small birds and mammals form the majority of its diet; voles are a particularly dominant food source locally in abundant areas. It nests in tall vegetation on the ground. The nest is a small, narrow platform, 20–40 cm wide, made of grass stems or thin twigs. Clutches are normally three to five eggs (Orta et al. 2014).","In the past, the use of organochlorine pesticides seemed to cause a decline in Europe (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is currently in decline owing to the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure in the species (Orta et al. 2014). Intensification on this land increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is commensal with some forms of agriculture, and changes in these practices could leave it potentially vulnerable by depleting its supply of small birds and mammals to prey on (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). It is highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Successful conservation programmes in Bavaria resulted in the population there growing from only a few pairs in the 1990s to 153 in 2008. Across Europe, particularly France and Spain, important protection measures have benefited the species. These measures include the rescue of nestlings from combine harvesters, chicks being moved to safety during harvesting and a small area around the nest being left untouched by the farmer. Mediterranean populations are highly dependent on these measures owing to high nest-failure rates in the absence of intervention (Ortaet al. 2014). Satellite tracking of this species began in 2005 (Trierweiler et al. 2007). Conservation Actions ProposedTall vegetation must be left during the breeding season, with high rates of chick mortality when this is harvested on agricultural land. The key management practices that include moving nestlings to safe places during harvesting, and leaving areas unharvested around the vicinity of nests should be continued (Ortaet al. 2014). In addition research on migration routes and the location and structure of stopover sites and wintering quarters of the species would assist the development of conservation measures (Trierweiler 2009).",,

It disperses south through Asia and Africa with a small number wintering in south-west Iberia (Wiersma et al. 2015).","Key factors explaining the magnitude of declines remain poorly understood, despite much recent research. On the breeding grounds it was probably formerly threatened by the conversion of steppe to arable cultivation, plus, perhaps less likely, the reduction in grazing by large herds of native ungulates and latterly by the loss of the enormous herds of domestic grazing animals from state-sponsored collective farms (Eichhorn and Khrokov 2002, Watson et al. 2006). However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, large areas of arable cultivation have been abandoned and are reverting to natural steppe habitat, herds of domestic livestock have become concentrated around villages (where their permanent presence leads to shorter swards than were created by the vast herds that grazed semi-nomadically under the Soviet system), while an increase in fires (owing to reduced control of fires) may also have contributed to an increase in suitable habitat. In parts of Kazakhstan, these factors are thought to be behind the possible increase in numbers in recent years and this may be the case elsewhere too (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Concentration of nests in heavily grazed areas in the vicinity of villages may have increased threats from human disturbance and trampling by sheep, goats and possibly other livestock (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Low egg survival due to nesting in areas of high grazer density has been suggested as one of the causes for the species's decline (Watson et al. 2006). The species may be affected by the increasingly dry climate in its breeding and wintering range, but it is not clear if this benefits or threatens this semi-desert species (Watson et al. 2006). Illegal hunting during migration and on the wintering grounds may now be the primary threat (M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007, Biricik et al. 2008). Data from 2005–2012 suggest that low adult survival, perhaps resulting from known hunting pressure along the migration routes, appears to be the most critical demographic rate (Sheldon et al. 2013).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II.

The group agreed on conservation measures required by each country, and planned cross-border actions to protect the species across its extensive range.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue research in Kazakhstan (and initiate in Russia) on breeding biology, habitat requirements and migration, including colour-ringing and satellite tracking to determine movements. Continue to monitor trends on breeding grounds and at key passage/winter sites. Identify and evaluate key threats on breeding, passage and wintering grounds. Investigate the importance of hunting on passage/wintering grounds. Review International Species Action Plan in the light of recent research on the breeding grounds and identification of key passage/wintering sites. Develop national species action plans, at least for Kazakhstan and key passage/wintering countries. At breeding colonies sensitive to trampling by sheep during nesting period, work with local shepherds to minimise disturbance. Control hunting on wintering/passage sites.",,

Migratory populations breed in Russia between mid-April to May and depart on a broad front for winter quarters in north-east Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan and northern India (Hayman et al. 1986) between mid-July and September (Wiersma 1996), although individuals occasionally winter in Russia, returning to breeding grounds during March and April (Hayman, et al. 1986). This species often breeds in loose colonies of between 4 and 24 pairs (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma 1996). Outside of the breeding season this species occurs singly, in pairs or small groups (Urban et al. 1986), with small migratory flocks of between 1-6 individuals and wintering flocks of 6-25 individuals (del Hoyo, et al. 1996). This species is diurnal (Wiersma 1996). The species shows a preference for habitats in the vicinity of shallow standing or slow-flowing water with suitable smooth beds permitting unhampered walking and wading (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma 1996). In Russia this species breeds in damp, vegetated areas near salt or fresh water, and on small vegetated islets or swampy shores of brackish lakes (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma 1996). During the winter this species prefers rivers, drainage ditches, ponds, coastal lagoons, marshes (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban, et al. 1986) and flooded or recently dried out grassland (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It also occurs on salt-shrub terrain with low, sparse vegetation, on shallow seepage pools by canals and reservoirs, and on irrigated rice fields (Cramp and Simmons 1983). During this season the species also occurs on dry ground near water such as river banks and lake shores (Urban et al. 1986, Wiersma 1996), but avoids dry, open country (Urban et al. 1986). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting mainly of insects (especially beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, fly larvae (Wiersma 1996) and locusts (Johnsgard 1981)), but also worms, molluscs and crustaceans (including freshwater shrimps). The nests of this species are shallow scrapes in the open, usually near water (Wiersma 1996). Few observations of nesting sites are available, but one was found on an irrigated but uncultivated field covered with grass, another was observed on a dry ridge near a marsh (Johnsgard 1981).",The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004).,Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is not listed on priority lists of the Conventions.Conservation Actions ProposedNo conservation measures are thought to be currently needed for this species.,,

Migration is overland at high altitude and occurs September to October and April to May (Maclean 1996).","Threats are poorly understood. Where declines are occurring the key factors probably relate to changing land-use practices such as conversion of steppe to arable agriculture in some areas, shifts in arable land versus livestock grazing on semi-natural steppe in others, and agricultural operations, such as harrowing. Declines occurring from the end of the 19th century in Ukraine and European Russia have been associated with the increase in ploughed areas and the loss of grazed steppe (Kamp et al. 2009).

Breeding begins in May and it is loosely colonial but highly territorial. The nest is a scrape typically lined with dead grass. Clutches are normally two eggs, but inexperienced birds may only lay one. It has a hugely varied diet owing to being a highly opportunistic feeder. Individuals regularly show individual specialisations in diet and feeding with some colony-specific learning. The species is migratory; wintering mostly off the coast of Iberia but younger birds will travel further (Furness 1996).","Declines in Shetland have been due to a recent reduction in sand eel stocks that have resulted in reduced breeding success and less birds at the largest colonies. Changes in fishing practices could also have serious impacts as more than half the summer diet at Shetland is made up of discards from fisheries (Furness 1996) and when discard rates are reduced this species will switch to predating other birds, especially if small shoaling pelagic fish are scarce (Votier et al. 2004). Fishing activities also pose a threat through drowning in fishing nets or being caught on hooks. Human persecution (often illegal) has limited the size of some colonies although harvesting for food has now nearly ceased (Furness 1996).

Colonies are located on exposed rocky cliffs and on offshore islands or islets, normally not more than 50 m above sea level. Characteristics of habitats used differ from region to region and even within the same areas in different years: altitude ranges from close to sea-level to 100 m, vegetation cover from bare rocks to 85% bush cover, and slope from 0–90°. During the non-breeding season the species prefers sheltered bays, either flat with shingle or sand or with cliffed margins (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It breeds in large monospecific colonies ranging from 10 up to 10,000 pairs. Egg-laying takes place in the second half of April until the beginning of May, and peak hatching occurs in late May (Burger and Gochfeld 1996), with fledging mainly in the first two weeks of July (Mañosa et al. 2004). The nest is a shallow scrape lined with available debris and vegetation (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It is placed among rocks and vegetation. Clutches normally have three eggs (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). It has a large foraging range while breeding, and has been recorded up to 200 km from the colony. The diet consists mostly of epipelagic fish, especially Clupeiformes (Mañosa et al. 2004). It is also known to take some aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, small birds and plant material such as the peanut (Arachis), olive (Olea), and grain (Cramp and Simmons 1983).  It is partially migratory and dispersive (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). After breeding the birds disperse widely around the Mediterranean coast (Sanpera et al. 2007, Burger and Gochfeld 1996). Almost all juveniles and some adults migrate past Gibraltar during July-October (Olsen and Larsson 2003), peaking in August (Guitiérrez and Guinart 2008), to winter on the North African coast (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).","The trawling fishery off the Ebro Delta is regarded as unsustainable and its collapse would probably result in a decline in the breeding population due to the increase in density-dependence (Oro et al. 2004, Tavecchia et al. 2007, Barov and Derhé 2011). A similar outcome would arise if waste from the trawlers were used industrially to produce food for domestic animals, as occurs in other areas, rather than being dumped near the Ebro colony. More important could be the reduction of small-pelagic fish stocks, the main natural prey for the species, due to increasingly high fishing pressure around the breeding grounds, owing partly to high demand by tuna-farming (Arcos et al. 2008). Other important threats include coastal tourism developments, regulation of the river Ebro, mortality due to entanglement in fishing gear (mainly longlines and sporting lines) (Belda and Sánchez 2001, Cooper et al. 2003) and predation by terrestrial predators, such as Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), Badger (Meles meles) and domestic dogs (Oro et al. 1999, Tavecchia et al. 2007). Predation by sympatric Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) can be high at some breeding colonies, especially when densities of Audouin's Gulls are low (Bonaccorsi 2003, Travichon 2004, Oro et al. 2006, Paracuellos and Nevado 2010). Predation on chicks by Black Rats (Rattus rattus) has a negative impact at some breeding colonies (Jones et al. 2008). Nevertheless this species shows a very nomadic breeding site selection and high dispersal rates from year to year, probably avoiding large densities of L. michahellis (Genovart et al. 2003, Martínez-Abraín et al. 2003, Oro and Matínez-Abraín 2007). Peregrines (Falco peregrinus), other raptors, some herons and snakes can also prey on adults and nests but only accidentally and locally (Oro 1996, 1997). Very high levels of mercury and other pollutants are found in this species (Sanpera et al. 2007), partly due to the consumption of discards (Arcos et al. 2002), thus posing a potential threat, although no negative effects have been demonstrated. Current marine wind-farm projects, particularly around the main breeding colony (Ebro Delta), could also represent a serious threat. Overgrazing of some islets by goats in the east of its breeding range may reduce breeding success. Natal and breeding dispersal are extremely high ensuring genetic mixing and buffering against bad local environmental conditions through emigration and colonisation (Oro and Ruxton 2001, Oro et al. 2004).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II. A European action plan was published in 1996 and its implementation reviewed in 2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). The ecology of this species, particularly its breeding and foraging behaviour, demography and population dynamics, has been extensively studied. Several LIFE Nature projects have been implemented between 1992 and 2006 in Spain and Italy, contributing to successful recolonisation of breeding islands and development of safe line-fishing techniques. Control of invasive Black Rats has been effective at some colonies (Jones et al. 2008). Culling of L. michahellis was conducted from 2000 to 2009 on Alborán Island, Spain, and demonstrated immediate local benefits (Paracuellos and Nevado 2010). However, even in small, remote colonies, culling needs to be continuous to avoid a return to the original situation (Paracuellos and Nevado 2010).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor breeding colonies. Identify appropriate actions to mitigate against the key threats. Implement strict fishery management policies in the species's range. Increase the area of suitable coastal habitat that is protected from development and degradation. Enforce laws designed to minimise marine pollution. Implement measures to reduce mortality in fishing gear, perhaps facilitated by legislation. Ensure regulation of the river Ebro benefits the species.",,

Sometimes appears as a vagrant in several countries in western and northern Europe (Burger et al. 2013).","The species is thought to be declining due to changes in conditions on its staging or wintering grounds (e.g. more severe winters, changing sea-ice distribution and thickness) (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005). It is also hunted (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005).The species's reliance on seal and whale blubber makes it particularly vulnerable to heavy metal- contamination (Tucker and Heath 1994) as has been found outside of Europe (Braune et al. 2006) which may have had a long-term effect on breeding productivity (C. Miljeteig in litt. 2007).

This species is migratory and disperses after breeding from coastal areas to the open ocean (Burger et al. 2013). It returns to its breeding grounds from January where it breeds from mid-May to mid-June in huge single- or mixed-species colonies (Burger et al. 2013) that often exceed 100,000 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998, Burger et al. 2013). Non-breeders may also remain at sea during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). It nests on high, steep coastal cliffs with narrow ledges in areas with easy access to freshwater (Burger et al. 2013). The species moults on sandy beaches (Olsen and Larsson 2003) and on passage it may concentrate at sea on continental shelves, areas of upwelling (Burger et al. 2013) and at rich fish banks (Olsen and Larsson 2003). During the winter the species is highly pelagic, usually remaining on the wing out of sight of land (Burger et al. 2013). Its diet consists predominantly of marine invertebrates (e.g., squid and shrimps) and fish, although during the breeding season it may also take intertidal molluscs, crustaceans (Burger et al. 2013) (e.g., crayfish) (Flint et al. 1984), earthworms, small mammals and plant matter (e.g., aquatic plants, potato tubers and grain) (Burger et al. 2013). Many species of fish have been recorded in diet, but sandeels (Ammodytes), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and herring (Clupea harengus) are particularly important (Burger et al. 2013).","The species is threatened by the depletion of food resources (e.g. through over-fishing) (Frederiksen et al. 2004, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), marine oil spills (Nikolaeva et al. 2006, Burger et al. 2013) and chronic oil pollution (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). It is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c. 10° latitude from the polar edge of continent and within which 20–50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under doubling of CO2 levels (BirdLife International, unpublished data). It is caught as bycatch in longline fisheries, with significant numbers estimated to be caught off the western coast of Ireland and the U.K.. The species is considered a high risk for collision with offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014).

Currently, birds are only known to breed on six inaccessible ledges although ongoing surveys may yet reveal more breeding sites (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007).","The European population is estimated at 70-80 pairs, which equates to 130-160 mature individuals. The entire population is found in the EU27. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species breeds on ledges on inland cliffs at 1600 m. Good vegetation and sufficient earth to dig burrows is essential for nesting (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). During the day it is seen no closer than 3–5 km to the shore and only returns at night (Tucker and Heath 1994). The breeding season begins in early April with egg-laying occurring May to early June. Clutch size is a single egg (Carboneras et al. 2014). Little is known about the diet but regurgitated material has contained small fish, squid and crustaceans (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory however there is little information on where it goes outside of the breeding season. Current evidence indicates most birds disperse widely to Mauritania and Senegal, NE Brazil, and the tropical waters along the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge to St Helena and west of the Gulf of Guinea (Carboneras et al. 2014).","Following the removal of all livestock from the breeding areas, the ecosystem had been recovering well prior to the 2010 fire, although breeding only occurs on ledges that were never accessible to grazing animals (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). The fire in 2010 (see Zino and Biscoito 2011) highlights the vulnerability of the species to such events, since it breeds on only six ledges at one location. As well as having a catastrophic impact on the survival of the year's fledglings and some adults, fires also increase soil erosion and make the habitat more barren, making the chicks more vulnerable to predation (P. Oliveira in litt. 2010). Currently, the main threats are predation of eggs and chicks by introduced black rats (Rattus rattus) and of nesting adults by feral cats (Felis catus). The increasing number of visitors at night may also cause disturbance to breeding birds, although this is being carefully monitored by the relevant authorities (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). The sole remaining breeding site is threatened by the construction of a NATO radar station on the summit of Mt Areeiro which began in November 2009. Although an Environmental Impact Assessment has been conducted to minimise the threat to the species, is it still feared that the construction and presence of the station will have a negative impact (Barov and Derhé 2011). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its altitudinal distribution falls entirely within 1,000 m of the highest mountain top within its range (1,861 m) (BirdLife International unpublished data). Shepherds formerly collected juveniles for food, and egg-collectors have raided nest-burrows in the past.","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is protected under Portuguese law. The breeding sites have been designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EU's Wild Birds Directive and lie within the Parque Natural da Madeira. A European Action Plan was published in 1996 and its implementation reviewed in 2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). Successful predator control and research has been carried out since 1986 by the Freira Conservation Project and the Parque Natural da Madeira, which has led to increases in the productivity of this species (Zino et al. 2001, Carlile et al. 2003). This programme was expanded in 2001 with additional funding provided by a multidisciplinary EU LIFE project, which also enabled the purchase of c.300 ha of land around the main breeding site (Menezes and Oliveira 2003, Unwin 2004). A project on the identification of marine IBAs in Portugal may allow the species to be studied at sea (I. Ramirez in litt. 2005). Over 2007-2010, dataloggers were attached to 14 breeding birds to determine the distribution of the birds at sea and seasonal changes in distribution from the breeding to non-breeding season (Zino et al. 2011). The Parque Natural da Madeira and SPEA have been monitoring the colony intensively since the 2010 fire and have developed an action plan for the breeding colony which includes immediate emergency measures to mitigate the consequences of the fire along with more long-term activities. As part of the emergency measures following the fires, anti-erosion coconut mesh was installed on the breeding ledges to protect the soil in some of the most critical places and c.100 natural nests were restored, while 60 new artificial nests were built. A protective cordon was also built around the known breeding areas, with cat traps and bait boxes (BirdLife International 2012, D. Menezes in litt. 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedInvestigate novel methods of cat predator control and continue control of rats. Exclude grazing stock from potential breeding areas. Continue research to determine the species's population status and distribution, such as searching for new breeding ledges. Monitor the known breeding population.

The species suffers predation by rats and feral cats at many of its breeding colonies (control programmes are in effect at some, while additional work is planned) (Zonfrillo 2007). Light pollution causing mortality has been recorded at some sites (e.g., Canary Islands) (Carboneras et al. 2014) and the species may also be displaced from foraging areas by shipping lanes. Habitat destruction and fire induced damage to breeding colonies within the Canary Islands is believed to impact on the species. The species is vulnerable to oil spills (Votier et al. 2005) and to other types of marine water pollution (Camphuysen et al. 2010).

It breeds on rocky coastal and offshore islets, and on the mainland (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is a colonial breeder, nesting in rock crevices or ledges in caves, occasionally in old rabbit burrows, lined with sparse plant material. It sometimes nests on cliffs. Clutch is a single white egg. The species forages mostly by pursuit-plunging and pursuit-diving. Diet composition varies through the year but consists mostly of fish, squid and crustacea (Carboneras et al. 2014). In the non-breeding season it disperses widely within the Mediterranean and Black Seas, often congregating in large flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998).","The most serious threat to the species is mortality from incidental fishing bycatch, followed by predation by invasive predators (predominantly rats (Rattus rattus) and to a lesser extent, feral cats (Felis catus)). A study in France and Malta (Oppel et al. 2011) implicated fishing bycatch as a critical cause of mortality for the species, since the majority of the adult mortality of birds breeding in Malta occurred during the non-breeding season. This pattern is consistent with the presumed cause of low adult survival probabilities in the Balearic Shearwater (Oro et al. 2004, Tavecchia et al. 2008). Long-liners in particular affect the species (Arcos et al. 2008, Louzao et al. 2011), often on an irregular basis, but impacting fairly large numbers at a time. Since Procellariiforms are generally long-lived, their populations are highly sensitive to changes in adult survival. The increased adult mortality induced by accidental bycatch is therefore a significant danger to them and a highly important threat (Lebreton 2000). These shearwaters have been shown to suffer substantial predation pressure by introduced mammalian predators on breeding grounds (Bourgeois et al. 2008, Bonnaud et al. 2009) with observed population declines in Italy being attributed to alien predators, predominantly rats (Sultana and Borg 2006, Capizzi et al. 2010), which heavily limit reproductive success by predation upon chicks and eggs. On the Tavolara archipelago, Italy, the colony size has been much reduced in the last 30 years and vast sectors of the islands have been deserted; breeding success was assessed for the first time in 2006 and it was found to be zero (due to rat predation) in several colonies (J. J. Borg in litt. 2006). Feral cats are a major threat. On the Hyères islands (French Mediterranean coast), feral cats have been identified as the primary predator of the species: shearwater remains were found in up to 6% of cat scats, representing hundreds of adults killed each year, especially during the pre-breeding period (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). Increasing tourism and coastal urbanization in the Mediterranean create sound and light disturbances at colonies and damages fragile breeding habitats (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008, Oppel et al. 2011). Breeding success may be affected by reduced abundance of anchovies and sprats due to competition from fisheries (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). The gregarious behaviour of this species makes it particularly vulnerable to oil spills and the intense maritime traffic in the Mediterranean and Bosporus increases the risk of oil spills. Less prominent threats include competition for nest sites with Cory's Shearwater, collisions with wind turbines, pollution and contaminants (e.g. plastic (R. Crnkovic in litt. 2012)), environmental events (such as toxic algal blooms and geological erosion) and illegal hunting (Derhé 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I.

It comes ashore only to breed (Jouanin and Roux 1965, Jensen 1981). On the Selvagens (Portugal) egg-laying is reported mid-March to early June, with the clutch a single egg (Carboneras et al. 2014). Birds excavate long burrows in sandy soil usually among thick vegetation which conceals the entrance hole (Snow and Perrins 1998). The breeding grounds on the Selvagens have a good covering of vegetation, mostly of ice-plants (Mesembryanthemum cristallinum), the roots of which stabilize the very sandy soil (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is present on breeding islands from March to September and may disperse to areas off the east coast of North America (Carboneras et al. 2014). It feeds mainly on planktonic crustaceans (Carboneras et al. 2014).","In general this species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and locally subject to exploitation by fishermen. It is also affected by predators such as mice (Mus musculus), rats (Rattus spp.), cats (Felis catus), owls, skuas (Catharacta), large gulls (Larus spp.) and snakes (Carboneras et al. 2014).

In 1992 the Department of the Environment launched a program to monitor the population and breeding success of the species. The European Union has granted the governing body of Lanzarote funding for a LIFE project in the Natural Park of the Chinijo Archipelago which provided some conservation actions that benefit the species. Chief among them was the eradication of rabbits from Clara Mountain Island, which has been a great success (Madroño et al. 2004). Conservation Actions ProposedHuman exploitation should be terminated and eradication of introduced predators on all breeding islands is also recommended (Carboneras et al. 2014). Develop and publish a Plan of Conservation for the species and ensure its guidelines are implemented. Planning tools of ENP should be developed and approved to restrict access to breeding sites. Light-reducing mechanisms should be developed in urban areas next to the breeding areas and injured birds recovered (Madroño et al. 2004). Programmes of eradication or control of cats and rabbits on islets with the species should be set up (Madroño et al. 2004, Carboneras et al. 2014) and mechanisms established to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous mammals, especially on Clara Mountain Island. Continue regular monitoring of the population and reproductive success, as well as conducting surveys in potential habitats in order to detect new colonies (Madroño et al. 2004).",,

It feeds mainly on the wing by pattering and fishing, and will occasionally follow ships and attend trawlers. Breeding starts in May and June, resulting in the formation of colonies on rocky ground on offshore islands and stacks that are largely free of mammalian predators (Carboneras et al. 2014).","The accidental introduction of predators, such as rats and cats to breeding colonies is a major threat to this species, particularly in southern Europe and the Mediterranean (Cadiou et al. 2012, Carboneras et al. 2014). In some areas, increases in numbers of skuas and large gulls appear to have increased the rate of predation. Reduction of prey, caused by unsustainable fisheries may also impact this species (Madroño et al. 2005). There may be some risk from eating contaminated food items or taking indigestible matter but, by feeding in flight, the species is less vulnerable to oil spills than some other seabirds (Tucker and Heath 1994, Newbury et al. 1998). Coastal development, particularly in the Mediterranean region has caused habitat destruction and disturbance (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including shifts in prey availability, and storms and extreme weather events. Light pollution from ships and coastal developments may also create a problem at night for this species (Jiménez et al. 2009, Sultana et al. 2011). In Molène archipelago, France, population has declined over last two decades due to continuous nest-site destruction (Carboneras et al. 2014).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species occurs within 88 existing marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs) across the region.

Its diet comprises mainly of small fish, squid, planktonic crustaceans and offal which is catches on the wing by dipping, skimming or snatching from the surface. It sometimes follows marine mammals feeding on left overs or faeces. Its breeding season is variable depending on locality, forming colonies on offshore islands on high ground or slopes, usually among rocks but also in soft soil between trees (Carboneras et al. 2014).","Species suffers severe predation, chiefly by native species including gulls (e.g. Herring (Larus argentatus), Great Black-backed (L. marinus) and Lesser Black-backed Gulls (L. fuscus)), Great Skuas (Catharacta skua), as well as from introduced mammalian predators; rats (Rattus spp.), cats (Felis catus), mice (Mus musculus), mink, otters and foxes; these are responsible for some local declines, and some colonies having moved to predator-free offshore stacks (Carboneras et al. 2014).

It requires sunny, warm, usually dry, and level or gently sloping terrain, with scattered bushes, shrubs or low trees providing hunting posts overlooking areas of short grass, heath or bare soil. High-quality habitats tend to feature mosaic-like grassy vegetation with alternating areas of tall and short growth and bare areas, with perches. In agricultural areas occupies neglected overgrown patches, heaths, open downs, overgrown orchards and gardens, hedgerows, and scrub along railways or roadsides. It is found also in temporary steppe-like habitats, such as military training areas, burned forests, forest clearings and spruce (Picea) plantations (Yosef et al. 2012). Egg-laying occurs from May to July (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997) and clutches are generally three to seven eggs. The untidy-looking nest is  a loose foundation of often green plant stems, roots, grass, lichen, hair, or similar, compactly lined with grass, hair, moss, fur, reed (Phragmites) or reedmace (Typha) flowerheads, plant down and similar material, situated in dense, often thorny bush such as hawthorn (Crataegus), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), bramble (Rubus) or dog-rose (Rosa) (Yosef et al. 2012). It is an opportunistic feeder, feeding mostly on insects and other invertebrates as well as small mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The species is migratory, wintering in eastern and southern Africa (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997).","Declines are probably due mainly to the loss and fragmentation of habitat resulting from afforestation and agricultural intensification, and the increased use of pesticides causing loss of food resources (Yosef et al. 2012). The heavy application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer causing the earlier and denser growth of vegetation may also be a threat (Tucker and Heath 1994).

Suitable breeding habitats in Europe include orchards, groves, parks, woodland edges and overgrown ditches even if close to human settlement or cultivation (Tucker and Heath 1994). Tall trees are necessary for nesting. It is found up to 700 m, rarely to 900 m in central Europe and to 1,500 m in Russia. It arrives at its breeding grounds from late-April to mid-May and egg-laying occurs May to early June. The nest is built by both sexes. It is a well-made structure with a loose foundation of twigs, grass, rootlets, string, etc., often with high proportion of green plants and lined with rootlets, feathers and hair but occasionally it is unlined. Clutch size can be from three to seven eggs but usually five or six. It is a specialized insectivore, although it also feeds on spiders and very rarely vertebrates (Yosef et al. 2008). Prey is taken from the ground and air, although the species requires few perches and often hovers. Unlike other shrikes food hoarding is rare (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is a long distance migrant and spends less than four months on its breeding grounds. European birds depart in the autumn and overwinter in southern Africa before beginning to return in late February or early March (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Agricultural intensification and an increase in monocultures have driven declines in western and central Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994). Heavy use of fertilizers since the middle of the 20th century has led to an increase in vegetation cover, causing wetter and colder micro-climates close to the soil, this, in turn, has negative effects on the large arthropod fauna on which this species relies (Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2008). The use of insecticides has also contributed to a decline in prey for this species.  Climatic fluctuations, causing wetter conditions in some areas of Europe and drier in others, are also thought to be a serious threat. The species suffers high losses due to predation by natural predators and human disturbance and in central Europe it is persecuted as a predator of song birds (Tucker and Heath 1994).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I.

It shows a preference for raised, open, unvegetated sand, gravel, mud or bare coral substrates for nesting. Outside of the breeding season the species frequents sandy or rocky beaches, estuaries, harbours and bays, often feeding over inlets and at sea. It breeds from May to June in dense colonies with other terns or Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus). The nest is a shallow scrape on raised, open, unvegetated sand, gravel, mud or bare coral substrates preferably far from upright vegetation (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) on sandy islands, rocky calcareous islets, sand-spits, sand-dunes and shingle beaches (Snow and Perrins 1998). Clutches are one or two eggs. The species forms very dense colonies during the breeding season in which the eggs of neighbouring pairs may only be 20 cm apart. Its diet consists predominantly of surface-dwelling marine fish (Snow and Perrins 1998) 9–15 cm long, as well as small shrimps, marine worms and shorebird nestlings. This species is migratory, undergoing post-breeding dispersive movements north and south to favoured feeding grounds before migrating southward (Gochfeld and Burger 1996).","The species is particularly vulnerable to human disturbance (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) (e.g. from tourists) especially near breeding colonies on beaches early in the breeding season (Bourne and Smith 1974). It is also sensitive to disturbance from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) (Garthe and Huppop 2004). It is threatened by the loss or degradation of its favoured breeding habitats through inundation, wind-blown sand and erosion (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), and has suffered previous local declines from exposure to bioaccumulated organochlorine pollutants in marine fish (Koeman et al. 1967, Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Other serious threats include recreational disturbance, coastal developments, pollution, land-use affecting vegetation and predation (Garthe and Flore 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II. A conservation scheme for the protection of gull and tern breeding colonies in coastal lagoons and deltas (Po Delta, Italy) involves protection from human disturbance, prevention of erosion of islet complexes, habitat maintenance and the creation of new islets for nest sites (Fasola and Canova 1996). The scheme particularly specifies that bare islets with 30-100% cover of low vegetation (sward heights less than 20 cm) should be maintained or created as nesting sites (Fasola and Canova 1996).Conservation Actions ProposedThe species responds favourably to habitat management such as vegetation clearance, and can be readily attracted to suitable nesting habitats by the use of decoys (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding pairs are also known to be attracted to coastal locations where artificial nesting sites have been constructed (e.g. beaches of bare shingle and islands or rafts covered with sparse vegetation) (Burgess and Hirons 1992).",,

It also shows a preference for nest sites close to clear, shallow, sandy fishing grounds in tidal bays and sheltered inshore waters (Snow and Perrins 1998). Throughout the year the species often rests and forages in sheltered estuaries, creeks (Urban et al. 1986), inshore waters and up to several kilometres offshore (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), moving to warm tropical coasts after breeding (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds in large, dense single- or mixed-species colonies that may contain several thousands of pairs.  The nest is a bare scrape in sand, shingle or coral rubble (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), preferably in sites surrounded by walls and rocks (Newton and Crowe 2000) or in the shelter of vegetation (in temperate regions) (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), also in crevices between and under rocks, or in the entrances to rabbit or Puffin burrows (Snow and Perrins 1998). Clutches are normally two eggs but can be only one in poor food years (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). This species is a specialist forager, and takes a small prey spectrum compared to Common Tern at the same sites (Birdlife International 2000). Its diet consists predominantly of small pelagic fish (Urban et al. 1986, Gochfeld and Burger 1996), particularly sand eel (Birdlife International 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000) and sprat (Birdlife International 2000) and sometimes clupeids (Birdlife International 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000) and gadoids (Newton and Crowe 2000), although it will also take insects and marine invertebrates (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Sandeel are particularly important during chick rearing (Newton and Crowe 2000). The species is migratory and Palearctic birds winter in west Africa (Gochfeld and Burger 1996).","The species is threatened by a number of agents, of which hunting in the wintering quarters may be the most significant (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Buckley and Buckley 1984, Cooper et al. 1984, Avery et al. 1995). At the northern European breeding grounds, the most significant threats are human disturbance (e.g., from habitat development, off-road vehicles and recreation (Buckley and Buckley 1984, van Halewyn and Norton 1984)) and predation from both natural and introduced avian and ground predators (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Buckley and Buckley 1984, Cooper et al. 1984, van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Avery et al. 1995, Snow and Perrins 1998). Disturbance and egg-collecting have been stopped in most areas by the use of wardens, but disturbance still threatens some major colonies in the Azores (van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Predation by rats, ferrets, red foxes and Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) occurs locally, and can have significant effects, including complete breeding failure at some Azores colonies (Avery et al. 1995). Natural predators can often take a great toll on localised colonies, particularly when terns are disturbed from the nest by other birds and humans (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Cooper et al. 1984). Habitat loss in northern Europe is not a major problem but has caused the local extinction of some colonies, as have extreme weather events (Avery et al. 1995). Climate change may negatively affect the species but the exact mechanisms are not known (Newbery 1999). The species is also vulnerable to pollution and disease (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Avery et al. 1995).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBreeding birds are fully protected by national and international law but at sea outside of European territorial waters or in the coastal waters of other countries protection is limited (Tucker and Heath 1994). An action plan for the recovery of the European population was launched in 1987 (Avery 1987) and most of its recommendations have been implemented (Avery et al. 1995). An International Species Action Plan was published in 1999 (Newbery 1999).Conservation Actions ProposedLegislative protection and enforcement should be introduced for the entire range of this species (Tucker and Heath 1994). Breeding pairs are known to be attracted to coastal locations where artificial nesting sites have been constructed (e.g. beaches of bare shingle and islands or rafts covered with sparse vegetation) (Burgess and Hirons 1992) and nesting-boxes provided (chicks may also use nest-boxes as shelters if adults do not nest in them directly) (Avery et al. 1995, Casey et al. 1995, Newton and Crowe 2000). Increased breeding successes can also be gained through nest-site vegetation management (Casey et al. 1995, Newton and Crowe 2000), landscaping (e.g. creating terraces or infilling flooded hollows), flood prevention (Newton and Crowe 2000), and continuous wardening to minimise unauthorised disturbance (Casey et al. 1995, Newton and Crowe 2000). Non-lethal predator control (e.g. destroying eggs and nests of gull species attempting to nest on islands) can also be successful in increasing the overall breeding success of the species (Casey et al. 1995, Leonard et al. 2004). Colonies which seem abandoned should still be protected and maintained to allow recolonization. At selected sites population and productivity monitoring should continue (Tucker and Heath 1994).",,

The species is exclusively marine and is a pursuit diver that propels itself through the water using its wings. The species is probably primarily a benthic forager, since much of the prey consists of benthic fish and invertebrates, including crustaceans (Bradstreet and Brown 1985, Cairns 1987a). Various studies find sandeels (Ammodytes spp.) (Harris and Riddiford 1989, Ewins 1990) and blennies (particularly butterfish Pholis gunnellus) (Harris and Riddiford 1989, Ewins 1990) to be the most important prey species of fish, although the relative contributions of each of these to the overall diet differs. Flatfish (Harris and Riddiford 1989) and gadoids (Ewins 1990) are also sometimes important. Adults tend to consume a higher proportion of invertebrates than the chicks do (Ewins 1990). The few data on winter food suggest that invertebrates are of greater importance during the winter than during the summer (Ewins 1990).","This species is likely to be susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance. The species is vulnerable to oil spills and other marine pollution (HELCOM 2013, Nettleship et al 2014). At the breeding colonies the species is vulnerable to invasive predators, such as rats, cats, and American Mink (Neovison vison) (HELCOM 2013). The species is susceptible to being caught in gillnets (Fangel et al. 2011, Zydelis et al. 2013), although other fishing gears may also catch significant numbers. Increasing numbers of offshore wind farms may result in displacement from habitat, and a low risk of collision (Bradbury et al. 2014).

Breeding colonies are located in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands, the U.K., Ireland and France on islands or high cliffs.The species nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea cliffs and rocky slopes (Nettleship et al. 2014). During the winter the species is highly pelagic and is dispersed widely across the sea from the Azores to the western Mediterranean and Canary Islands. When feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). Birds of this species are pursuit-divers that catch most of their prey within 30 m of the water surface (Piatt& Nettleship 1985). They prey on 'forage' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring (Clupea harengus), juvenile and adult capelin (Mallotus villosus), and sand eel (Ammodytes spp.) (Barrett et al. 1987). At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids (Harris and Hislop 1978, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). Sand eels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Harris and Riddiford 1989, Martin 1989), and many chicks starve during periods of low sand eel abundance (Martin 1989).","This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance (Durant et al. 2003, Sandvik et al. 2005). This is a particularly important threat when prey species are exploited unsustainably, leading to prey reductions and subsequent unsuccessful breeding. The species is vulnerable to oil spills and other marine pollution. The species is also vulnerable to extreme weather events and storms, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea. At the breeding colonies the species is vulnerable to invasive predators, such as rats, cats, and American Mink (Neovison vison). The species is susceptible to being caught in gillnets, although other fishing gears may also catch significant numbers.

This, along with nest wardening, rebuilding of damaged nests and the provision of artificial nests in safe locations where necessary, would also assist breeding success.

In more temperate regions the species is sedentary or only locally dispersive (Pierce and Boesman 2013). The species breeds solitarily or in loose colonies of 2–50 or occasionally up to several hundred pairs (Urban et al. 1986, Pierce and Boesman 2013). It is typically a gregarious species, occurring in small groups (Snow and Perrins 1998) (up to 15 individuals) (Urban et al. 1986, Pierce and Boesman 2013) or larger flocks of several hundred up to a thousand individuals on migration, during the winter (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) and at nightly roosts (Urban et al. 1986).The species typically breeds in shallow freshwater and brackish wetlands with sand, mud or clay substrates and open margins, islets or spits near water level (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable habitats include marshes and swamps, shallow lake edges, riverbeds, flooded fields, sewage ponds (Pierce and Boesman 2013), irrigated areas and fish-ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also breed around alkaline and high-altitude (montane) lakes (Pierce and Boesman 2013) or in more saline environments such as river deltas, estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow coastal pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (Pierce and Boesman 2013) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species occupies the shores of large inland waterbodies and estuarine or coastal habitats (Pierce and Boesman 2013) such as river deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow freshwater or brackish pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (Pierce and Boesman 2013) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998).

The nest is a depression or shallow scrape positioned on hard ground near water on a hummock (Flint et al. 1984) or amongst grass and sedge (Pierce and Boesman 2013). Alternatively the nest may be a more elaborate platform of vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) constructed on a floating mass of aquatic vegetation.

",Decreasing,"This is very much a European species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It breeds from Spain and Portugal east through central Europe to Ukraine, north to southern Sweden, Latvia and the U.K., and south to southern Italy. Populations winter within the western breeding range, and formerly in isolated patches south and east to eastern Turkey (Knott et al. 2009).","The European population is estimated at 25,200-33,400 pairs, which equates to 50,400-66,800 mature individuals. The population in the EU27 is estimated at 24,000-31,900 pairs, which equates to 48,000-63,700 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","The species breeds in broadleaf woodlands and forests, mixed with farmland, pasture and heathland. In winter it also occupies farmland without trees, wasteland, scrub and wetlands. Formerly an urban scavenger, it still visits the edges of towns and cities. Eggs are laid between March and May. The nest is a platform of sticks, often with rags or plastic incorporated, and normally lined with wool. It is built in a fork or on a wide side branch of a tree (coniferous or broadleaf), in forests, woods or clump of trees. Each pair normally has several nests, using the same one each year or alternating. Clutches range between one to four eggs, normally two but sometimes three. It takes a wide range of food, but feeds mainly on carrion and small to medium-sized mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are less important prey. Most birds in north-east Europe are migratory, wintering mainly in southern France and Iberia, but with some travelling as far as Africa (Orta and Christie 2013). Migrants travel south from their breeding grounds between August and November, returning between February and April (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes form small flocks, possibly family groups, when soaring on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The most pertinent threat to this species is illegal direct poisoning to kill predators of livestock and game animals (targeting foxes, wolves, corvids etc.) and indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from consumption of poisoned rodents by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, where it is driving rapid population declines (A. Aebischer in litt. 2009); there is a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter 2007). The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted (J. Vinuela in litt. 2009). Illegal poisoning is also a serious threat to the species in north Scotland, with 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 having been killed by poisoning (Smart et al. 2010). In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops (P. Tourret in litt. 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott et al. 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious future threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen et al. 2009, P. Tourret in litt. 2009) and more research needs to be conducted to assess the level of threat windfarms pose to the species. Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009),  hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009), road-kills, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) and possibly competition with the generally more successful Black Kite (Milvus migrans) (Cardiel in litt. 2000, Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001, Cardiel and Viñuela 2007, Mammen 2007). Another factor implicated in the declines in France and Spain is a decrease in the number of rubbish dumps (Cardiel and Viñuela 2007, Mionnet 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. Annex II Bern Convention. The species is on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive and is the focus of close monitoring and targeted conservation actions across most of its range, including reintroduction to parts of the U.K. since 1989 (English Nature 1995, RSPB 2007). Since 2007, further reintroduction projects are aiming to re-establish the species in Tuscany and in the Marche (Italy), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland - the first breeding attempt in the Republic was recorded in 2009. An EU species action plan for the Red Kite was published in 2009 (Knott et al. 2009). National species action plans are in place in Germany, France, the Balearic Islands and Denmark, and a draft national action plan is in place in Portugal. Ongoing research in Germany aims to examine further the impact of windfarms on the breeding population of this species. In 2007, for the first time, three young birds in France were fitted with satellite transmitters, although only one provided regular information (Mionnet 2007). In Spain, radio-tracking was carried out in Segovia in 2006-2007.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor population trends and breeding productivity. Continue to manage reintroduction projects. Regulate the use of pesticides, especially in France and Spain. Reduce persecution through law enforcement, prosecutions and awareness campaigns. Carry out further studies into the impact of changing land-use practices. Lobby for changes in EU and national agricultural policies. Increase the area of suitable woodland and forest with protected status. Work with land-owners to protect habitat and prevent persecution. Consider extending supplementary feeding to more areas of low food availability. Ensure national legislation on animal by-products takes into account the needs of scavengers.

In Europe, the population consists of a few isolated groups from the Caucasus to the Pyrenees (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The population has grown in the Alps (with the emergence of new breeding pairs due to a reintroduction project), and in the Pyrenees, particularly in its central part (Aragon, Spain) (J. A.

The population in the EU27 is estimated at 180-180 pairs, which equates to 350-360 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species occupies remote, mountainous areas, with precipitous terrain, usually above 1,000 m and in particular, areas where large predators such as wolves and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are present, and there are herds of mammals such as Mountain Goats, Ibex, and sheep (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is typically monogamous but polyandrous trios occur in the Pyrenees, probably in response to habitat saturation (Orta et al. 2014). Nesting occurs in December or January and the young hatch in February and March (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species will construct large nests (averaging 1 m diameter), composed of branches and lined with animal remains such as skin and wool, as well as dung and occasionally also rubbish. Nests are located on remote overhung cliff ledges or in caves and will be re-used over the years (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Clutches are one or two eggs. Both parents take part in nest building, nest defence, incubation, brooding and feeding of chicks (Orta et al. 2014). The species will forage over vast distances, using a soaring flight. Its principle food is carrion, with its diet including a large proportion of bones (as much as 85%) whereupon the bird gets nutrition from the marrow inside. The rest of its diet comprises tortoises, and occasionally also live mammals and birds. It is generally unwilling to compete with vultures at carcasses, and will wait patiently to feed, scavenging older carcasses if fresh meat is scarce. Bones are either consumed whole, broken using the bill, hammered against the ground, or lifted into the air and dropped from 50-80 m high onto hard rock. Tortoises are generally treated in the same way as bones. It is resident where it occurs, but has vast home ranges, and juveniles will wander even more widely than adults (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The main causes of ongoing declines appear to be non-target poisoning, direct persecution, habitat degradation, disturbance of breeding birds, inadequate food availability, changes in livestock-rearing practices and collisions with powerlines and wind turbines (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Barov and Derhé 2011, S. Xirouchaki in litt. 2012). Despite the provision of targeted conservation actions, the European population remains susceptible to poisoning, and mortality caused by powerlines (J. A. Gil Gallus in litt. 2011). Since European reintroductions began, mortality from shooting has decreased, however poisoning (both intentional and accidental) has increased (Margalida et al. 2008).Veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens as mortality sources among scavengers that feed on medicated and diseased livestock carcasses have recently emerged as a threat. Three of five failed eggs of this species and four dead nestlings sampled in the Spanish Pyrenees from 2005-2008 had high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs (especially fluoroquinolones) and evidence of several livestock pathogens (Blanco and Lemus 2010). Rapid increases in grazing pressure and human populations in the mountains of Turkey are causing habitat degradation there (S. Viter in litt. 2014). Suitable habitat is also threatened by pipeline construction through the Caucasus mountains (S. Viter in litt. 2014).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. In Europe, captive breeding and reintroduction programmes have been carried out in the Austrian, French, Italian and Swiss Alps with individuals subsequently spreading into other parts of France (Frey and Walter 1989, Snow and Perrins 1998). Reintroduction programmes are underway in parts of Spain (J. A. Gil Gallus in litt. 2011). Feeding stations have been provided in the Pyrenees with resulting increases in numbers of the species, and the provision of similar stations across the species's range could improve its global population density (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).Conservation Actions ProposedConduct coordinated surveys to monitor the species's population trend. Assess the threat posed by diclofenac and other drugs used in livestock, as well as the impacts of climate change. Reduce disturbance in and around nesting areas.

It relies heavily on soaring flight using thermals, and thus avoids large bodies of water (Meyburg et al. 2014). Birds are generally observed singly or in pairs, but will congregate at plentiful food sources, and migrate in flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Aspinall 2010). It breeds near forest edges, preferring moist woodland; most nest in lowlands but it is recorded breeding up to 2,200 m in montane areas. Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are all taken as prey, with different prey types predominating in different parts of its range. Egg-laying occurs in late April and early May. Nests are built in trees, usually close to the forest edge and are a large stick construction, lined with green twigs and sometimes grass. Eyries are often reused over several years.

It nests 5–25 m above ground in tall, usually broad leaf, trees inside the forest, a few 100 m from the edge. Both sexes construct a large platform of sticks with a central cup lined with fresh green sprigs or grass. The nest is often used in successive years and may therefore become very large, although many pairs have two or three nests used alternately. Clutch size normally two but second chick rarely survives due to cainism (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). It feeds on unretrieved quarry, small mammals, waterbirds, frogs and snakes. It hunts over swamps, wet meadows and, in Europe, over extensively managed agricultural land (A. Lõhmus in litt. 1999); birds soar to c.100 m high when hunting.It is a migratory species, with birds leaving their breeding grounds in October and November to winter in southern Europe, southern Asia and north-east Africa (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). They generally return in February and March. Birds migrate on a broad front, tending to pass in singles, twos and threes with the occasional larger group (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They do not concentrate at bottleneck sites to the extent of many other raptors such as Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina) (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013).","There is strong evidence of hybridisation between this species and C. pomarina (Bergmanis et al. 1997, Lohmus & Vali 2001, Dombrovski 2002, Vali et al. 2010). In some European countries mixed pairs can constitute 50% of pairs of this species (Maciorowski and Mizera 2010) or even more (Vali 2011). It is unclear whether this represents a new phenomenon or a conservation concern, but C. pomarina is far more numerous than C. clanga in the zone of overlap, and the range of C. pomarina appears to be spreading east, further into the range of C. clanga. Other key threats are habitat destruction and disturbance, also poaching and electrocution can be considered important. Suitable habitat mosaics have been lost as a result of afforestation and wetland drainage. In eastern Europe, agricultural intensification and the abandonment of traditional floodplain management have reduced habitat quality (A. Lõhmus in litt. 1999). Birds are intolerant of permanent human presence in their territories. Forestry operations are a major cause of disturbance. Shooting is a threat in Russia and the Mediterranean (P. D.

It returns to its breeding grounds between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and breeding occurs April to July. Birds time their arrival for spring and the start of breeding is highly dependent on availability of its chief prey species. The nest is constructed of sticks with the nest cup lined with smaller twigs and many other materials, such as old rags, bones, moulted feathers and camel dung. Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees. It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas (Meyburg and Boesman 2013). When susliks are scarce they will feed on middle-sized mammals or dead saiga antelope (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (Meyburg and Boesman 2013).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).

The species has not been recorded as breeding in Málaga province since at least the early 1970s (J. R. Garrido in litt. 2013). The species recolonised Portugal in 2003, after an absence of breeding activity for over 20 years (S. Cabezas-Díaz, J. C. Atienza et al. in litt. 2013).","The European population is estimated at 370-380 pairs, which equates to 740-750 mature individuals. The entire population is found in the EU27. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species occurs in alluvial plains and dunes in the Guadalquivir marshes, plains and hills in central Spain, and high mountain slopes in the Sistema Central and other areas of Portugal, where there is an absence of irrigated farmland (Fernández et al. 2009). It nests only on trees, typically in the crown (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). Data from Doñana National Park in Spain show that the most important variables explaining nest site selection are height of tree and distance from human activity (Bisson et al. 2002). Both adults construct the nest, a large structure of twigs with a cup lined with green twigs, fur, grass and debris. Each pair has between two to six nests, but reuse of same nest in consecutive seasons fairly common. Clutch size is between one to four eggs (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). The abundance and distribution of rabbits, its favoured prey, influences population density, range (Fernández et al. 2009) and reproductive performance. Indeed, its evolutionary dependence on rabbits has been suggested as permanently limiting its abundance and distribution (Ferrer and Negro 2004), although a recent study has suggested the species exhibits a certain dietary plasticity, at least during the non-breeding season, adapting its diet when rabbits are scarce (Sánchez et al. 2010). Many recently-colonised territories are in marginal areas, and several of the occupying pairs include at least one sub-adult bird (González and Oria 2004, González et al. 2006b, Margalida et al. 2007). Adults are sedentary but young birds, when they become independent disperse in all directions (strongly influenced by prevailing winds at time of departure), regularly travelling up to 350 km (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013).","The analysis of 267 records of non-natural mortality in this species over a 16-year period (1989-2004) shows an average annual rate of 15.1 individuals found dead annually, and that electrocution (47.7%) and poisoning (30.7%) were the most frequent causes of mortality (González et al. 2007). Juveniles are frequently killed through electrocution by powerlines, and this has increased in recent years (L. M. González in litt. 2005). This remains the primary threat in Andalucía, with six birds found to have died this way in 2011 and three found dead in 2012 where mitigation measures had been attempted (J. R. Garrido in litt. 2013). Renewable energy development poses another potentially significant threat. Habitat fragmentation has occurred as a result of deforestation for agriculture and timber, having negative impacts on nest site preferences in particular. Suitable habitat in breeding and dispersal areas has also declined as a consequence of urban development and land-use changes (e.g. new irrigation schemes in Huelva (B. Sánchez in litt. 2007)). Mortality from intentional poisoning has risen sharply, particularly in hunting reserves where game is commercially exploited. Between 1990 and 1999, 57 birds died from poisoning and this is thought to be the primary cause of declines in the late 1990s (J. Criado in litt. 1999). In Doñana National Park in particular, the population has been seriously affected by the illegal use of poisoned bait, especially during the 1990s (Ortega et al. 2009). Rabbit populations have declined in both Spain and Portugal, as a result of viral haemorrhagic disease, and this is believed to have reduced breeding success (Margalida et al. 2007; S. Cabezas-Díaz, J. C. Atienza et al. in litt. 2013). In addition, changes in the management of hunting estates in both Spain and Portugal to favour larger quarry species, such as deer and boar, rather than rabbits and partridges, has further reduced prey availability (B. Sánchez in litt. 2007, S. Cabezas-Díaz, J. C. Atienza et al. in litt. 2013). In spring 2009, a male bird was shot and killed in Portugal, highlighting the current threat of hunting to this species. Human activities in the vicinity of active nests can disturb incubating adults and reduce hatching success (González et al. 2006, Margalida et al. 2007). The ingestion of lead shot embedded in the flesh of prey items may be a problem in certain areas (González and Oria 2004, Pain et al. 2005). Recent modelling suggests no subpopulations are currently at risk of extinction, provided that active management is maintained (L. M. González in litt. 2005).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. There are 24 Important Bird Areas identified for the species, 22 in Spain and 2 in Portugal. Altogether, there are 107 areas protected by Law (national and EU Special Protected Areas,) containing c.70% of the total breeding population (Barov and Derhé 2011). Since 1987, national and regional governments have been implementing a coordinated conservation plan for the species. A European action plan was published in 1996 and updated in 2008 (Sánchez et al. 2008), and a national plan is being implemented. From 1991-1999, 14,370 dangerous electric towers were modified, considerably reducing deaths from electrocution (L. M. González in litt. 2005) and more recently, work has been carried out to isolate dangerous powerlines on private farms (Cabezas 2011). It is thought that nearly €2.6 million were spent on the mitigation of bird electrocution in Andalucía during 1992-2009, although not all mitigation measures have proved to be totally effective for this species (J. R. Garrido in litt. 2013). A supplementary feeding programme has been established to mitigate the effects of rabbit decreases, and has significantly increased breeding success (L. M. González in litt. 2005). Nest monitoring has reduced disturbance and improved reproductive success. The Flying High Programme created by SEO/BirdLife in 2006, begun its second phase in 2009 until 2012, based on a large land stewardship network (of municipalities, land-owners and schools). This network focuses on habitat management, species conservation, awareness and information activities covering the species’s entire distribution. So far, 54 municipalities have joined the network. Work is on-going to raise awareness and support on private land where the species breeds, including improving habitat management (García 2007), and nearly 50% of breeding pairs are covered by such projects (L. M. González in litt. 2005). From 2002 to 2011, 73 young birds were released in Cádiz as part of a reintroduction project, and by 2012 five breeding pairs had become established in the province; however, mortality associated with powerlines appears to be high amongst these birds (M. Pandolfi in litt. 2003, B. Sánchez in litt. 2007, J. R. Garrido in litt. 2013). Nevertheless, the establishment of a breeding population in Cádiz further reduces the overall probability of extinction (Muriel et al. 2011). Two birds originating from a reintroduction project in Andalucía are known to have bred in Portugal (J. R. Garrido in litt. 2013).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue with actions to reduce mortality, particularly from poisoning and electrocution (González and Oria 2004). Survey the breeding population annually. Approve regional recovery plans (González and Oria 2004).  Maintain an adequate area of legally protected habitat (e.g. within the Natura 2000 network (González and Oria 2004)).  Protect and manage breeding sites and key dispersal areas.  Continue the successful nest monitoring and supplementary feeding programmes  and develop a captive breeding programme to support future reintroduction and supplementation efforts.  Promote the recovery of the rabbit population (González and Oria 2004). Modify dangerous powerlines.  Avoid the construction of wind farms in key areas for the species (B. Sánchez in litt. 2007). Increase coordination between private landowners, NGOs and government (González and Oria 2004, B. Sánchez in litt. 2007).",,

In central and eastern Europe, it breeds in forests up to 1,000 m and also in steppe and agricultural areas with large trees, and nowadays also on electricity pylons. In Turkey it is known to very rarely nest on the ground or on cliffs. In the Caucasus, it occurs in steppe, lowland and riverine forests and semi-deserts (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). Wetlands are apparently preferred on the wintering grounds. From late-February to early-May adults return to breeding areas. Both sexes construct a large stick nest, typically 100?150 cm in diameter with the nest cup lined with green sticks and other materials such as grass, fur and wool. Clutches are usually two to three eggs (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). It hunts small to medium-sized mammals as well as birds and carrion. In the Caucasus the main prey include hare, tortoises, lizards and carrion (Tucker and Heath 1994). Adults in central Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey and the Caucasus are usually residents, whilst most immatures move south. (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013).","Breeding sites are threatened primarily by intensive forestry in the mountains, and by the shortage of large indigenous trees in the lowlands. Other threats are loss and alteration of feeding habitats, shortages of small and medium-sized prey species (particularly ground-squirrels Spermophilus spp.), human disturbance of breeding sites, nest robbing and illegal trade, shooting, poisoning and electrocution by powerlines. Habitat alterations associated with agricultural expansion threaten historical and potential breeding sites in former range countries. Hunting, poisoning, prey depletion and other mortality factors are also likely to pose threats along migration routes and in wintering areas.","Conservation Actions Underway CITES Appendix I.

It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1,000 km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (>65°N), such as Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in south-east Europe and the Russian steppes. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson- Lees and Christie 2001). The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line (Watson 2010), from sea level to 4,000 m (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species’s diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5–4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson- Lees and Christie 2001). Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2 m in diameter. The breeding season spans March – August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson- Lees and Christie 2001).","The species was heavily persecuted in the 19th Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped, and it is declining in Spain (Katzner et al. 2012a).  In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are records of mortality as a result of electrocution when perching on power lines, but no data to suggest any substantial demographic impact. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species (Watson 2010).  Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner et al. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices and climate change, may threaten the species in the future (Watson 2010).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II.

The banning of poisons and the introduction of legal protection in some areas of its range have permitted the species to increase or at least stabilize in many countries (Ortaet al. 2013).Conservation Actions ProposedEnforcement of protection against illegal killings and egg-collecting is needed in many countries. Education programmes demonstrating the benefits and desirability of maintaining healthy populations of this species should be implemented. In remote upland areas, general land-use policies should not compromise key feeding and nesting requirements. There is a particular need to protect extensive areas of wooded peatland in north-east Europe.

Juveniles often occupy areas near large water bodies (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In the Mediterranean region egg-laying occurs mainly from February to mid-March (Orta et al. 2013). The nest is up to 2 m in diameter, composed of sticks and located on remote cliff ledges or in a large tree. The nest is re-used in successive years (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and pairs will often have several nests. Clutch size is normally one or two eggs but very occasionally three (Orta et al. 2013). The eagle's prey principally comprises of small or medium-sized birds, but it will also take mammals, some reptiles, insects and rarely, carrion (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is resident throughout its range, although juveniles will disperse up to 200 km and individuals occasionally wander further afield and pass through key migration routes (Shirihai et al. 2000, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","Since the 1950s the species has declined throughout its range.

Migratory birds winter in southern Africa; northern birds leave their breeding grounds in September and return in March and April (Orta and Boesman 2013). Migrants are thought to partially cross water on a broad front (assumed from regular occurrence on islands across the Mediterranean), but nevertheless many pass through bottleneck short crossing points each season. Birds tend to be seen singly or in pairs, and even on migration rarely form groups of more than five, and stay away from other raptors (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds soar c.200–300 m above the ground when hunting (Brown et al. 1982). It is a species of open woodland, preferring patches of forest interspersed with open areas; it is recorded up to 2,000 m. Small birds are the most important part of its diet. Nests are built in trees and are made of sticks and twigs, lined with fresh leaves. They are often reused each year.

Several thousand pairs breed outside this range, principally in central Asia. Western Palearctic populations have undergone serious declines, although a few have begun to increase again. The western European population has declined by c.95% since 1950, and the species has disappeared from the Ural region of Russia and from northern Kazakhstan, as well as from the western and central parts of the Balkan Peninsula (Davygora 1998, B.

It forages in steppe-like habitats, natural and managed grasslands, and non-intensive cultivation. It is mainly migratory, with most breeders overwintering in sub-Saharan Africa, although some travel to parts of north-west Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia. Migrants leave their breeding grounds in September and return between February and April (Orta and Kirwan 2015). It migrates in flocks of varying sizes, usually tens to low hundreds, often with other falcons such as F. tinnunculus, F. vespertinus and F. amurensis (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Large numbers, sometimes up to thousands, gather at roosts on migration (Orta and Kirwan 2015). They cross water bodies readily on a broad front, flying high enough to be barely detectable; they fly lower over land (often c.20–30 m), particularly on northward migration (Brown et al. 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It breeds colonially and egg-laying occurs mainly in May, nesting mainly in human constructions, such as large old buildings, houses, walls and ruins, in towns or on the outskirts but also uses natural sites, for example rock faces, clay banks and quarries, and occasionally old corvid nests. The nest is placed in a hollow or below eaves, and it has also taken readily to artificial nesting boxes in some areas. Clutches are normally three to six eggs. It feeds mostly on aerial and terrestrial insects. It is a trans-Saharan migrant although some birds winter in southern Europe and northern Africa (Orta and Kirwan 2015).","The main cause of its decline was habitat loss and degradation in its western Palearctic breeding grounds, primarily a result of agricultural intensification, but also afforestation and urbanisation. The use of pesticides may cause direct mortality, but is probably more important in reducing prey populations. The neglect or restoration of old buildings has resulted in the loss of nest-sites (Davygora 1998, J.-P. Biber in litt. 1999). At La Crau in southern France, where such nest sites are rare, a population increase in the 1990s may be linked to the progressive selection of ground nests in stone piles, reducing interspecific and intraspecific competition (Prugnolle et al. 2003).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix I and II.

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October and those arriving in sub-Saharan Africa do so from October onwards (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The return journey begins from February through until April (the exact time probably dependent on food availability), and is often undertaken in small mixed groups with F. naumanni and occasionally F. vespertinus (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).

It feeds mainly on small mammals, particularly in northern Europe, with insects possibly more important in the Mediterranean. The locations of nests are variable, with rock ledges, buildings and abandoned corvid nests being commonly reported sites. Typically lays three to six eggs (Orta and Boesman 2013).","Past population declines resulted from the heavy use of organochlorine and other pesticides in the 1950s–1960s (Orta and Boesman 2013). In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. Bern Convention Appendix II. The ban of organochlorine pesticides, which were used heavily during the 1960s and 1970s has allowed this species to recover in some areas (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).Conservation Actions ProposedThis species requires wide-scale conservation, which alleviates agricultural intensification. Policies should encourage mixed farming and high crop diversity and maintain non-cultivated marginal habitats, which decrease stocking rates and pesticide use (Tucker and Heath 1994). Management should also ensure suitable perches and roosting sites, usually provided by trees, telegraph poles, buildings or rock faces are maintained (Orta and Boesman 2013). Kestrel populations should be monitored, particularly with regards to the effects of modern farming (Tucker and Heath 1994).",,

It winters in southern Africa (P. Palatitz in litt. 2007, Orta and Kirwan 2014).","The European population is estimated at 30,300-63,400 pairs, which equates to 60,600-127,000 mature individuals. The population in the EU27 is estimated at 1,800-2,800 pairs, which equates to 3,500-5,600 mature individuals. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","The species breeds in open lowlands with trees and plenty of insects, including steppe and forest-steppe, open woodland, cultivation and pastureland with tall hedgerows or fringing trees, agricultural areas with shelterbelts and, in the north-east, boggy areas and taiga edge. It is found from sea-level to c.300 m. It is often crepuscular (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The breeding season occurs from mid-April to August (Orta and Kirwan 2014). It is usually colonial but can also be solitary, breeding in disused nests of other birds (most commonly Corvus frugilegus). It prefers the upper part of trees but sometimes nests in cliffs or tree holes, in hedgerows or isolated bushes (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Kirwan 2014). Usually lays four to five white or pale buffish-brown eggs variably marked with dark reddish brown. The diet comprises of large insects, especially Orthoptera but also beetles, dragonflies, butterflies, moths and cicadas. During breeding, chicks may be mainly fed with vertebrates, such as fledglings of small birds, voles, mice, shrews, amphibians, lizards. In Hungary, mice and toads are important. The species is migratory, with birds travelling great distances to their wintering grounds in southern Africa (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Most leave their breeding grounds in August and September, making the return journey between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds migrate in a broad front across the Mediterranean Sea, not concentrating at bottleneck sites to the extent that many other raptors do (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Kirwan 2014). On migration they form mixed flocks often over 100 strong with other falcons such as F. naumanni, and tend to stay at very high altitudes for the majority of the journey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","Threats include destruction of suitable nest-sites when rookery trees are felled for agricultural expansion or timber (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001, Anon. 2007) and, more significantly, the widespread use of pesticides is affecting the food supply (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001). In central Europe, agricultural intensification is causing habitat loss, and a decrease in extensive grassland management especially grazing is affecting the species's food supply (P. Palatitz in litt. 2007). From 1980 to 1999 intensive poisoning of Corvus frugilegus in Hungary forced the species to change its nest site selection habits, and large colonies have nearly disappeared there as a result, with only 38% of the population breeding colonially (P. Palatitz in litt. 2005). As productivity is generally greater in larger colonies, further decreases may occur. The species appears to be hunted opportunistically during migration. In October 2007, 52 birds that had been roosting at Phasouri, Cyprus, were found shot, with 46 already dead and 6 wounded (Palatitz et al. 2009).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix I and II. Bern Convention Appendix II. Added to Annex I of EU Birds Directive in 2004. Recent conservation measures in Hungary have shown that birds will occupy artificial colonies, meaning that this could be a useful mid-term conservation tool to stop population fragmentation (P. Palatitz in litt. 2007). The species is also included in agro-environmental programs in Hungary. Following surveys in Bulgaria, which indicated a decline in the number of suitable breeding sites, over 100 nest boxes were constructed and installed in suitable places during 2006; however, none were used by the species in 2007 (Anon. 2007). Anti-poaching patrols have been increased in the Akrotiri area of Cyprus, following the unprecedented loss of a migratory flock to hunters in October 2007 (Palatitz et al. 2009). Sporadic irregular population surveys have been carried out and are implemented in Serbia, while a nation-wide census of the species was concluded in 2009 in Ukraine (Kostenko 2009). A European Action Plan for the species has been in place since 2010 (Palatitz et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to carry out regular surveys to monitor population trends. Conduct further research into the effects of changes in agriculture and land management. Change farming and land-use practices in central Europe through EU policy and/or national schemes. Provide more artificial colonies for the species. Prevent hunting in problem areas through law enforcement, prosecution and awareness campaigns.",,

The return journey begins in late April and May (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds are known to fly as high as 1,000 m during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). They are generally gregarious (though sometimes solitary), tending to move in small and loose flocks, and on migration often associating with other species flying at high altitudes, including F. subbuteo (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They hunt mainly at twilight (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds usually breed and stop over on small islands and islets, wintering mainly in open woodland on Madagascar. It feeds on large flying insects and small birds. Birds nest in the holes and ledges of sea cliffs, or on the ground. Clutches are usually two or three eggs (Orta and Kirwan 2014).",The species has historically suffered from exploitation and persecution brought about by local people. Human disturbance associated with tourism development has also been shown to negatively influence birds’ breeding success (Orta and Kirwan 2014).

Monitoring programmes exist in most countries at a national level and in protected areas in Greece, Spain and Cyprus (Barov and Derhé 2010). Private research on the species has been conducted on an archipelago off Crete for three decades, in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg and the area became an SPA in 1997 (Ristow 1999). An EU LIFE Nature project, ‘Conservation measures forFalco eleonorae in Greece’ was set up in 2003, which met with much success performing the first ever global population census of Eleonora’s falcon, undertaking many public awareness campaigns, and reducing nest predation through rat eradication programmes (Hellenic Ornithological Society 2008).Conservation Actions ProposedEffective actions to protect coastal areas should be implemented and Environmental Impact Assessments conducted on all developments in coastal areas. National and international coastal tourism policies should discourage the development of new resorts and favour environmentally friendly, sustainable tourism. Colonies should be protected by non-intrusion zones. Wintering areas and their ecological requirements and threats should be identified and protection implemented for these and areas of migration habitat. The impacts of rat predation should be investigated. Awareness of the species should be raised and the value of its habitat promoted (Barov and Derhé 2010).",,

It generally prefers areas with some trees or scrubby vegetation. On migration it inhabits an even broader range of habitats, often along sea coasts. It breeds from March to June and does not build a nest. Instead, it uses old stick nests of other species especially corvids (Corvus, Pica) in trees but also uses tree cavities, cliff ledges or stick nests on ledges and the ground.

Birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, arriving at wintering quarters from late October onwards. The return journey begins in March and April, and breeding territories are occupied again in May and June.  Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs or family groups, even on migration, with larger groups being rare except at roosts and especially rich feeding sites (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It migrates in broad fronts and does not generally concentrate at narrow sea crossings as do many other migratory raptors (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Kirwan 2014). It is mainly diurnal although partly crepuscular and even nocturnal to some extent on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It occurs in open wooded areas, including wooded steppes, pastures, cultivation or scrub with clumps of trees, scattered trees or copses; fields with hedges, edges of woods. Flying insects form the main part of its diet, although birds are often taken in the breeding season. It uses unoccupied nests of corvids or other raptors, or squirrel dreys, but does not add material and is almost always in trees, preferring pines, but also in other conifers and broad-leaved trees; exceptionally on cliffs. Clutches are typically three eggs (Orta and Kirwan 2014).","The cutting of old growth forest patches in Ukraine is thought to have caused local declines (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Some are shot, notably in Malta where hunters are thought to kill 500–1,000 individuals each year. A growing threat is human disturbance, which facilitates nest predation by crows and squirrels. Pesticide use has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg-collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).

In the northern Apennines where the mountainous habitat is largely forested, the species occurs in areas comprising at least 50% open landscapes. Coastal areas are generally avoided, with most pairs holding inland territories 200–600 m above sea-level, and in Sicily more frequently approaching 1,000 m (Tucker and Heath 1994).Eggs are laid between February and May. It frequently nests on the old structures of corvids, other raptors or herons, usually in trees or on electricity pylons. Alternatively it uses scrapes on cliffs, the ground, quarries or buildings. Clutch size is usually three or four eggs (Kemp 1994). The diet is mostly small to medium-sized birds as well as some small mammals, reptiles and large insects (Tucker and Heath 1994). It will hunt by fast aerial pursuit from a stoop or horizontal chase, often around a water-hole and often with a pair combining in attack (Kemp 1994). Birds are usually recorded singly or in pairs, but are known to gather in groups of up to 20 at concentrated feeding sites (Kemp 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Most birds are resident and migration is only recorded outside of Europe (Kemp 1994).","In the mid-20th century the species underwent severe declines in Europe, driven by poisoning, shooting and trapping for falconry (Kemp 1994). These threats have subsided, though persecution and the collection of eggs and chicks for falconry still probably constitute the most serious threats to the species. In Italy it is still threatened by illegal shooting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and in other countries where Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) are hunted (Gustin et al. 2000). It is also vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Habitat loss through urbanisation, modification of agricultural practices, construction of roads, open-cast mining, agricultural expansion into steppe and grasslands and afforestation has caused a reduction in hunting areas and prey species.

It uses copses or cliffs for nest sites (sometimes even the ground), occupying the old nests of other birds. Clutch size varies from two to six, with means from 3.2-3.9 in different circumstances. Breeding success varies with year (especially in areas where rodents cycle) (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species usually occurs singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are sedentary, part-migratory or fully migratory, largely depending on the extent to which the food supply in breeding areas disappears in winter (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrating central European adults travel as far as the Mediterranean. Juveniles are mainly migratory with central and eastern European birds wandering from the Balkans to Turkmenistan, Egypt and north-west India (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Migrating birds generally leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning between February and May (del Hoyo et al. 1994).","In Europe, this species has suffered mainly from the loss and degradation of steppes and dry grasslands through agricultural intensification, plantation establishment and declines in sheep pastoralism, causing a decline in key prey species; offtake for falconry is a serious problem, which has caused local extinctions (Baumgart 1991, 1994, K. Ruskov in litt. 2007). In eastern Hungary, landscape reversion following the abandonment of agriculture could have a negative influence, as most prey species require short swards that are maintained by agricultural practices (S. Nagy in litt. 2007). Elsewhere, declines are mainly attributable to offtake for falconry, although persecution, pesticide use and agrochemical deployment play a lesser part (Baumgart 1991, Riddle and Remple 1994, Barton 2000, Eastham et al. 2000, Fox 2002, Haines 2002, ERWDA 2003).

It is listed on CMS Appendix I and II (as of November 2011, and excluding the Mongolian population) and CITES Appendix II, and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on U.A.E., strongly affecting the unregulated market there (Fox 2002). It occurs in a number of protected areas across its range. Intensive wardening and management has produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (Baumgart 1994). Controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in western range in the 1990s (Baumgart 1994). Captive breeding has developed strongly in some countries as a means of substituting farmed for wild-caught birds (Riddle and Remple 1994, N. Fox in litt. 2002). New research programmes in many parts of the range have begun to establish baseline data on distribution, population, ecology and threats. As a product of the resolution resulting from CMS COP10 in November 2011, a Saker Falcon Task Force was established and met for the first time in March 2012 in Abu Dhabi (U.A.E.). The task force has the objective of involving range states, partners and interested parties in the development of a coordinated Global Action Plan for the species's conservation, including a management and monitoring framework. Conservation efforts in Europe have resulted in positive population trends (A. Dixon in litt. 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedMaintain or implement programmes of population and habitat management throughout the range. Maintain or improve systems of wardening and customs control (including DNA sampling to check provenance of traded birds). Continue key biological research (Baumgart 1991, 1994). Enforce CITES regulations. Improve exportation standards including meeting IATA transportation specifications. Improve import regulations, staff capacity and practices (quarantine facilities). Monitor markets to quantify falcon trade. Develop existing microchipping schemes to help monitor and regulate trade and quantify its effects.

An international species action plan was published in 1999 (Koskimies 1999).Conservation Actions ProposedCo-operative efforts between national authorities and non-governmental conservation bodies should look to stop the illegal collection of eggs and young. In some areas of Fennoscandia, more rigorous controls on snow mobile traffic is needed as this has facilitated the collection of wild birds. The legal trade of birds should be more strictly controlled. Important sites for this species should be protected from hydroelectric power dams, roads and tourist establishments. Finally, the effects of acid rain, overgrazing and hunting pressure on grouse populations should be monitored to ensure healthy populations (Tucker and Heath 1994). National species action plans should be developed in range countries and research should be developed on population viability and limiting factors, wintering populations and migration routes and the feasibility of reintroductions. Awareness of the species’s status should also be raised (Koskimies 1999).",,

Suitable habitats include small lakes, ponds, the sheltered bays and vegetated shores  of larger freshwater and reservoirs, canals (Llimona et al. 2014), slow-flowing rivers (Konter 2001), flood-plain oxbows, coastal brackish lagoons, alkaline or saline lakes, rice-fields (Brown et al. 1982), seasonally inundated areas, swamps, sewage lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004) and gravel pits (Santoul and Mastrorillo 2004). Outside of the breeding season it is common on more open waters and is occasionally observed along the coast in estuaries or sheltered bays protected from strong wave action (Llimona et al. 2014) and when moulting the species requires rich feeding areas (Fjeldsa 2004).The timing of breeding varies geographically and depends on the growth of emergent vegetation and water-levels (Llimona et al. 2014). In Europe, egg-laying begins in late February (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic plant matter (Llimona et al. 2014) anchored to emergent vegetation (Fjeldsa 2004), submerged branches or bushes close to the edge of shallow wetlands (Brown et al. 1982). Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects, especially mayflies, stoneflies, water bugs, beetles, flies, caddisflies and dragonflies, as well as molluscs, crustaceans, adult and juvenile amphibians and occasionally small fish (up to 11 cm) (Llimona et al. 2014) during the winter (Konter 2001). This species is sedentary, locally dispersive or fully migratory depending on the winter temperatures of its breeding grounds (Llimona et al. 2014).","The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of this virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). In Europe numbers often fluctuate, mainly as a result of winter conditions, such as the marked decline in Britain after the cold winter of 1962–1963, and similarly in the Netherlands after that of 1984–1985. The species suffers from the transformation of wetlands by destruction, pollution or recreational use but this is often offset by construction of man-made ponds, reservoirs and dams, leading to expansion of species in many areas (Llimona et al. 2014).",Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II. The species was included in the Grebes Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan published in 1997 (O'Donnel and Fjeldsa 1997).

Suitable habitats include small pools and lakes, backwaters of large rivers, pools cut off from the sea in estuaries (Llimona et al. 2014) and coastal lagoons. In coastal locations the species often makes foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas, and if foraging at sea it shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). When moulting, on passage or during the winter the species frequents large inland lakes or shallow coastal areas (Fjeldsa 2004) with abundant fish stocks (Llimona et al. 2014), often considerable distances from the shore, amongst islands in archipelagos or over drop-off zones (Fjeldsa 2004).The bird breeds from April or May to June or August. The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation. Clutches are normally three or four eggs (Llimona et al. 2014).

Suitable habitats include small pools or lakes, backwaters of slow-flowing rivers and artificial waterbodies (Llimona et al. 2014). The species overwinters on large exposed ice-free (Fjeldsa 2004) lakes and reservoirs, moving to sheltered coastal inshore waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) less than 10 m deep (Fjeldsa 2004) such as brackish estuaries, deltas, tidal channels and tidal lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998) during cold spells (Fjeldsa 2004). In Europe, it breeds between April and September. The nest is a platform of aquatic plant matter either floating on water and anchored to emergent vegetation or built from the lake bottom in shallow water (Llimona et al. 2014). Typical nest sites include reedbeds or flooded thickets as well as more open sites such as floating mats of water-weed or kelp fronds (Fjeldsa 2004). Normally three to five eggs are laid. Its diet consists predominantly of large fish as well as insects, crustaceans (e.g. crayfish, shrimps) and molluscs, occasionally also adult and larval amphibians.

Habitats include small pools, marshes with patches of open water and secluded sections of larger lakes and rivers (Llimona et al. 2014). In its wintering range the species frequents coastal inshore waters (Llimona et al. 2014) up to 10?20 m in depth (Fjeldsa 2004) including sheltered bays (Llimona et al. 2014), lagoons and estuaries (Ogilvie and Rose 2003). It may also occur on large lake and river systems south of its breeding range (Llimona et al. 2014, Fjeldsa 2004). The species breeds from April to August, generally in solitary isolated pairs.

Its diet consists predominantly of fish and invertebrates such as adult and larval insects, crustaceans (Llimona et al. 2014), crayfish (Fjeldsa 2004) and crabs (Konter 2001), molluscs and worms. Fish and crustaceans are more important components of the diet during the winter when the species is at sea (Llimona et al. 2014).

In marine environments it occurs in sheltered coastal areas on estuaries (Orta et al. 2014), saltpans, coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1993, Orta et al. 2014), deltas (Johnsgard 1993) and coastal bays (Brown et al. 1982), requiring rocky shores, cliffs and islets for nesting (Orta et al. 2014) but generally avoiding deep water and rarely extending far offshore (Snow and Perrins 1998). It also inhabits fresh, brackish or saline inland wetlands (Nelson 2005) including lakes, reservoirs, wide rivers, flood waters (Orta et al. 2014), deep marshes with open water, swamps and oxbow lakes (Johnsgard 1993), requiring trees, bushes, reedbeds or bare ground for nesting (Orta et al. 2014) and avoiding overgrown, small, very shallow or very deep waters (Nelson 2005).

At sea the species preys mostly on bottom-dwelling fish, occasionally also taking shoaling fish in deeper waters (Orta et al. 2014).","The species is often persecuted by the aquaculture industry and may be shot, drowned or poisoned in attempts to control numbers (Carss 1994, ICN 2006) or for hunting (Bzoma et al. 2011). It may also suffer from disturbance and displacement from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) (Bradbury et al. 2014), and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease (Kuiken 1999) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these viruses (Kuiken 1999, Melville and Shortridge 2006). Recreational activities taking place at sea may also cause displacement from critical habitat. The species is susceptible to oil spills across its range.

For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","The species is a coastal species that shows high nesting site fidelity. The species breeds in colonies (Orta et al. 2014) that can hold more than a thousand well-spaced pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998, Nelson 2005). It is largely sedentary (Orta et al. 2014), although immatures may undergo post-breeding dispersive movements over short distances (Orta et al. 2014). Some birds undergo short-distance migrations during winter. Individuals often forage alone when away from nesting colonies and in winter (Orta et al. 2014, Snow and Perrins 1998), but may follow dense shoals of fish in flocks of several hundred individuals (Nelson 2005). It occupies marine habitats but does not usually occur far from land (Orta et al. 2014). It shows a strong preference for rocky coasts and islands (Orta et al. 2014) with adjacent deep, clear water (Nelson 2005), and forages over sandy and rocky seabeds (Orta et al. 2014). The species feeds on a wide range of benthic, demersal and schooling, pelagic fish. Sandeels (Ammodytidae) are the dominant prey of birds in British and some Spanish populations (Wanless et al. 1997, Velando and Friere 1999, BirdLife International 2000, Velando et al. 2005), and are consistently present in the species's diet in most other locations studied. These are usually caught at, or near, the sea bed (Wanless et al 1997). Other prey species include fish of the families Gadidae, Clupeidae, Cottidae, Labridae, and Trisopterus spp. (Orta et al. 2014), although birds also take small numbers of polychaetes, cephalopods, other molluscs and small benthic crustaceans (Wanless and Harris 1997). Adults provision their chicks with sandeels, but consume a broader variety of prey for themselves (BirdLife International 2000). The Mediterranean subspecies feeds mainly on coastal fishes, caught from the bottom or mid water over rocky or sandy seabeds, but economically important fish seem to form a very small part of the diet (Aguilar and Fernandez 1999).","The species is persecuted (e.g., shot, intentionally drowned or poisoned) at commercial fisheries and fish farms as it is perceived to be a threat to fish stocks (Carss 1994, Wanless and Harris 1997). It also suffers predation at nesting colonies by introduced American mink (Neovison vison) (Wanless and Harris 1997), is vulnerable to coastal oil pollution (Wanless and Harris 1997, Velando et al. 2005), locally suffers from accidental entanglement and subsequent drowning in gill-nets (fishing nets) (Wanless and Harris 1997, Velando and Freire 2002), and is susceptible to the Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Kuiken 1999).

This species is a generalist in its habitat use, although shallow water, relatively large prey, and four or five months of ice-free breeding season are among the essential characteristics of its habitat (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to 500 or even 1,000 m, occasionally breeding much higher (Snow and Perrins 1998) (2,000 m in Armenia), inhabits any kind of shallow water, either fresh, brackish or saline, both standing or flowing, and shows a preference for areas with trees as it is commonly an arboreal rooster and nester. Some degree of isolation and protection are also typical of places chosen for roosting and nesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is found inland on broad rivers, narrow streams, lake shores, ornamental ponds, fish-ponds, marshes, flood-plains, reeds swamps, rice-fields and other irrigated areas (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), river oxbows, reservoirs, ditches, canals, sewage farms, inland deltas, and on islets and emerging rocks (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the coast the species also frequents deltas, salt-marshes (Brown et al. 1982, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), estuaries, tidal mudflats, muddy and sandy shores, and sand-spits (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists predominantly of fish and eels 10–25 cm long, as well as amphibians, crabs, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, snakes, small rodents, small birds (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and plant matter (although this may be incidental, or only to aid in pellet formation) (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The nest is a stick platform that is often re-used over successive years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually positioned high in a tall tree up to 50 m, but also on the ground or on cliff edges, in reedbeds or in bushes. In reed-beds nests may be built of reeds, and ground nests may be reduced to a slight scrape, ringed with small stones and debris (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species commonly nests in colonies and nesting sites are typically situated 2–38 km (convenient flying distance) from preferred feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","In Europe the species was heavily persecuted in the nineteenth century due to its consumption of fish, which resulted in competition with fishermen and fish farmers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Although killing at aquaculture farms has not reduced the global population so far (possibly because it is young birds that are mostly killed) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), 800 herons are estimated to have died per year at Scottish fish-farms between 1984 and 1987 (Carss 1994, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) by being shot, drowned or poisoned by fish farmers (Carss 1994). Renewed hunting poses a threat to Bavarian populations by decreasing numbers to levels that inhibit recovery following severe winters (severe winters increase mortality rates for juveniles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Timber harvesting is a threat throughout much of the species range by removing trees used by nesting colonies and/or disturbing nearby colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.",Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is not listed on priority lists of the Conventions.Conservation Actions ProposedFreshwater habitats need to be sustainably managed.

The species breeds from April to June in the western Palearctic. It is a colonial breeder (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014, Turner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and although nesting group sizes are usually small and rarely exceed 50 pairs (Turner 2000), colonies of up to 1,000 pairs have been recorded in some areas (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It often also nests on the periphery of colonies of other heron species such as Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In migratory populations the autumn migration occurs from August to October (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), with the return passage in the spring beginning in March (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). The species is mainly crepuscular, but may also feed diurnally. The species inhabits wetlands from sea level to 1,800 m (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), showing a preference for dense, flooded, freshwater reedbeds (Phragmites spp.) in temperate areas (occupying Typha, Scirpus and Papyrus swamps elsewhere) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It also utilises lake shores, river margins (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), ditches, canals, brackish water lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields and coastal mudflats (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Its diet consists of fish 5–15 cm long (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (occasionally up to 55 cm), salamanders (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), frogs, insects (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. beetles, dragonflies, hemiptera (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and locusts (Hancock and Kushlan 1984)), crustaceans (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), spiders (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and molluscs (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) as well as small birds and mammals, snakes and lizards (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is a platform of reeds stems or sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) positioned over or beside water up to three metres high in flooded reedbeds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), three to four metres high in thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or up to 25 m high in trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species usually nests in loose single- or mixed-species colonies with A. cinerea, and although colony sizes are usually small, large groups of up to 1,000 pairs have been recorded (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).","The main threat to this species in Europe is the loss of reedbeds though direct elimination (to reduce sedimentation) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), agricultural encroachment (Hockey et al. 2005), water management practices (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. drainage) (Hockey et al. 2005) and reed cane harvesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).Conservation Actions ProposedStudies in southern France have shown that the overall conservation of this species in Europe is favoured by maintaining large uncut reedbeds with relatively high spring water levels (Barbraud et al. 2002).

Palearctic populations are migratory (Flint et al. 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), sometimes with other species. Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species is a diurnal feeder (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments its feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown et al. 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (Snow and Perrins 1998). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey et al. 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown et al. 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1–15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than one metre apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) for example through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990).

It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown et al. 1982, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), feeding in loose flocks of 10–20 individuals (Brown et al. 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species is a diurnal feeder (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey. The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), dry arable fields (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), artificial grassland sites (e.g., lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It occurs from sea-level up to c. 1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown et al. 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter may also be taken (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).

The species breeds from April to July in Eurasia in single- or mixed-species colonies that can be up to 2,000 pairs in size. After breeding Palearctic populations migrate south from August to November (Kushlan and Hancock 2005. Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), returning to the breeding colonies between February and May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species feeds solitarily (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or in small groups of 2–5 individuals during the breeding season (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) although in winter and on migration large feeding flocks may form (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is mainly crepuscular (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), roosting by day and night in large (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) often mixed-species (Brown et al. 1982) groups in sheltered woods and reedbeds (these roosts may draw in herons feeding up to 80 km away) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species inhabits permanent or temporary wetlands (Brown et al. 1982) showing a preference for fresh waters with abundant marsh vegetation (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), reedbeds, nearby bushes, trees and scrub (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Habitats frequented include swampy plains, river valleys, deltas, lakes, ponds, canals, ditches and rice paddyfields (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). On migration (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) the species may also occur on estuaries, inshore reefs or islets (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It generally avoids dry habitats and those with very high rainfall (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and usually breeds in the lowlands although it has bred on montane lakes up to 2,000 m. Its diet consists predominantly of larval insects although fish and amphibians (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. frogs and tadpoles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) up to 10 cm long, grasshoppers, beetles, butterflies, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs and exceptionally small birds may also be taken. The nest is a well-constructed platform usually placed less than two metres (occasionally up to 20 m) high near or over water in reedbeds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) or in dense thickets of trees or shrubs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. of willow (Salix spp.) or poplar (Populus spp.)) (Hafner and Didner 1997), preferring nesting sites within five kilometres of feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds in single- or mixed-species colonies that can be up to 2,000 pairs in size (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), neighbouring pairs building nests 5–10 m apart (occasionally as close as 0.5 m) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).",The greatest threat to this species is the loss and deterioration of natural and man-made freshwater habitats (e.g. through changes to flood regimes in rice paddyfields) and wet woodlands (e.g. through woodcutting and burning) (Hafner and Didner 1997).,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).Conservation Actions ProposedReed marshes and freshwater habitats need to be sustainably managed, including the reduction of water pollution and fish overexploitation.",,

Post-breeding southward movements occur from September to October and return northward movements occur from March to May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In temperate regions breeding occurs in the local spring (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in small numbers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single- or mixed-species colonies, although sometimes groups may reach several thousand pairs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). When nesting within mixed-species colonies the species tends to form monospecific clusters (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species inhabits fresh, brackish or saline waters with aquatic vegetation and trees (e.g. pine, oak) for roosting and nesting in (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), showing a preference for islands or predator-free areas for nesting sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occupies the forested margins of shallow rivers, streams, lagoons, pools, ponds, lakes and marshes and may feed on pastures, reservoirs, canals, aquaculture ponds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and rice-fields (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On migration the species may also frequent dry grasslands or marine coasts (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and estuaries (Hockey et al. 2005). It is common at elevations of up to c. 2,000 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is an opportunistic feeder taking fish, frogs, tadpoles, turtles, snakes, lizards, adult and larval insects (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and dragonflies) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, leeches, small rodents, bats and the eggs and chicks of other bird species (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is a platform constructed of sticks and vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) placed 2–50 m above water or on dry ground near water (Snow and Perrins 1998) in trees, bushes, reedbeds, on cliff ledges and on the ground (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland drainage and destruction (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and by drought in wintering areas (Hafner and Kushlan 2002). It is highly susceptible to pesticides (Kwon et al. 2004, Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) such as organophosphates, carbamates (Kwon et al. 2004) and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) which negatively affect hatching success (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). There are also cases of genetic damage to chicks as a result of petroleum contamination (Custer 2000). The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Kuiken et al. 2006). It is also persecuted (anti-predation killing) at aquaculture facilities due to its depredation on fish stocks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and has suffered declines due to the exploitation of chicks from nesting colonies in the past (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Chicks of the species are still taken for food in some areas (Hafner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).Conservation Actions ProposedA study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992). The creation of a network of new nesting sites spaced at 4–10 km in relation to available foraging habitats in zones currently without suitable nesting sites is also recommended (Fasola and Alieri 1992).

Continental populations are mainly migratory however (Newbery et al. 1996, Kushan and Hancock 2005) with a marked post-breeding dispersal of immatures (Kushan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds from March to June in Eurasia. The species has highly restrictive breeding habitat requirements (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015). It shows a strong preference for quiet lowland marshes around lakes and rivers (less than 200 m Asl) (Kushan and Hancock 2005) with extensive dense young reedbeds of Phragmites spp. (e.g. with one to three years worth of new growth (Marion et al. 2000, Puglisi et al. 2005) but still maintaining some old or dead stems) that are flooded but are fairly shallow (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) (less than 30 cm deep) (Newbery et al. 1996), have few fluctuations in water-level (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), have low acidity (Kushan and Hancock 2005) and are surrounded by clear open areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) of deeper water, which is maintained into the driest part of the breeding season (Gilbert et al. 2005). Breeding adults are more attracted to unfragmented (Puglisi et al. 2005) reedbeds over 20 ha in area, although smaller sites with networks of reed-fringed waterways or open wetland habitats with a number of small reedbeds (Newbery et al. 1996) (greater than 100 m) (Gilbert et al. 2005) over a wide area may also be used (Newbery et al. 1996). The species frequents a more varied range of habitats outside of breeding season, foraging on rice-fields, watercress beds, gravel pits, fish farms, ditches, sewage farms (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), small ponds and wet grassy areas (Kushan and Hancock 2005) as well as marshes and reedbeds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015). It also forages in running water when still waterbodies freeze during the winter (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). Its diet varies depending on the site and season although it predominantly takes fish (particularly cyprinids and eels) and amphibians as well as adult and larval insects, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, snakes, lizards, birds, nestlings and small mammals (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015). The nest is a pad of reeds and other vegetation (Kushan and Hancock 2005) constructed close to or floating on water (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) amidst dense reedbeds (Kushan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015).","The species is threatened mainly by the loss of Phragmites reed marshes (Kushan and Hancock 2005) owing to habitat alteration through drainage (Kushan and Hancock 2005), direct destruction (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), changes in traditional management (e.g. changes to reed harvesting regimes) (Marion et al. 2000), sea level rise and salt water intrusion (Newbery et al. 1996), the effects of wave action from boat traffic at the edge of open water (Marion et al. 2000), and pollution (Marion et al. 2000, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) (either eutrophication which modifies fish populations within reedbeds or pesticides which may reduce the species's survival) (Marion et al. 2000). Disturbance from humans during the nesting period is also a threat (Newbery et al. 1996, Marion et al. 2000, Kushan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. disturbance from reed cutting (Kushan and Hancock 2005), noisy recreation and water-sports (Newbery et al. 1996, Marion et al. 2000, Kushan and Hancock 2005), motor vehicles and hunting (Kushan and Hancock 2005)). The hunting of adults and collecting of eggs and chicks still occurs in some areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), and the species may suffer high mortalities in very cold winters (especially in sedentary populations) (Marion et al. 2000).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA). European Union International Action Plan for the Conservation of this species was published in 1996 (Newbery et al. 1996).Conservation Actions ProposedBreeding adults in Europe may be more attracted to unfragmented (Puglisi et al. 2005) reedbeds over 20 ha in area, although smaller sites with networks of reed-fringed waterways or open wetland habitats with a number of small reedbeds over a wide area may also be used (Newbery et al. 1996). There is evidence that females in Britain preferentially nest in locations surrounded by less scrub but more vegetated open water, with a higher proportion of Phragmites spp. than other plant species, and in areas where deeper water is maintained into the driest part of the breeding season (Gilbert et al. 2005). The European Action Plan for this species recommends raising water levels, harvesting and burning reeds, cutting invasive scrub, or digging out reedbeds on a rotational compartmental basis as methods of slowing reedbed succession (Newbery et al. 1996). It also recommends the regular cutting of small areas of reedbed to maintain Phragmites spp. monocultures (Newbery et al. 1996), to provide a range of multi-age reed stands (Kushan and Hancock 2005) and to favour the retention of water levels in spring and summer (promoting rapid growth, preventing a build-up of reed litter and providing foraging sites) (Newbery et al. 1996). Large-scale reed cutting should be prohibited in the late-winter however (Kushan and Hancock 2005). Wetlands should also be managed to enhance the carrying capacity of fish and eel populations (thus increasing food resources for bitterns) (Noble et al. 2004, Self 2005, Gilbert et al. 2007). In Britain it was found that suitable habitats should be provided for all fish life stages (including spawning, refuge and overwintering), the movement of fish throughout reedbeds should be promoted (e.g. by changes in hydrological management regimes and sluice design) (Noble et al. 2004) and issues relating to water quality, zooplankton and macrophyte community structures should be addressed (Self 2005). Measures should include sustainably managing river valleys and reed marshes, including the reduction of water pollution and fish overexploitation. Disturbance at the breeding sites by recreation should be minimized.",,

It will also frequent sewage treatment pans, inland dams (Hockey et al. 2005), estuaries (Brown et al. 1982) and coastal waters (Diawara et al. 2007), seldom alighting on freshwater but commonly bathing and drinking from freshwater inlets entering alkaline or saline lakes (Brown et al. 1982). It nests and roosts on sandbanks, mudflats, islands (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 2014) or boggy, open shores (Flint et al. 1984). It breeds regularly from March to June in large dense single-species colonies of up to 20,000 pairs (occasionally up to 200,000 pairs).The species nests in large dense colonies on mudflats or islands of large waterbodies, occasionally also on bare rocky islands (del Hoyoet al. 2014). The nest is usually an inverted cone of hardened mud (Flint et al. 1984) with a shallow depression on the top (alternatively it may be a small pile of stones and debris when mud is not available). Its diet consists of crustaceans, molluscs, annelid worms, larval aquatic insects, small fish, adult terrestrial insects, the seeds or stolons of marsh grasses, algae, diatoms and decaying leaves. It may also ingest mud in order to extract organic matter (e.g., bacteria) (del Hoyo et al. 2014). Juveniles, and to a lesser extent adults (Mateo et al. 1998), are prone to irregular nomadic or partially migratory movements throughout the species's range in response to water-level changes (Snow and Perrins 1998, Hockey et al. 2005).","The species suffers from low reproductive success if exposed to disturbance at breeding colonies (Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986, Yosef 2000) (e.g., from tourists, low-flying aircraft (Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986) and especially all-terrain vehicles (Yosef 2000)), or if water-levels surrounding nest-sites lower (resulting in increased access to and therefore predation from ground predators such as foxes and feral dogs) (Miltiadou 2005). The species also suffers mortality from lead poisoning (lead shot ingestion) (Mateo et al. 1998, Miltiadou 2005), collisions with fences and powerlines (Hockey et al. 2005), and from diseases such as tuberculosis, septicemia (Nasirwa 2000) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

The removal of sand polluted with lead shot from a salt-lake in Cyprus was successful in significantly reducing the numbers of deaths due to lead poisoning (Miltiadou 2005). At two colonies (one in France and one in Spain) management techniques to counteract erosion and the lack of suitable nesting islands were successfully applied in order to encourage breeding by the species (Martos and Johnson 1996). The species is also kept and does well in captivity (del Hoyoet al. 2014). The Flamingo Specialist Group was established in 1978 to actively promote flamingo research, conservation and education worldwide.Conservation Actions ProposedThe conservation of all wetlands used by this species for feeding and breeding is important and breeding sites should be monitored to ensure the continuation of appropriate habitat management techniques (Tucker and Heath 1994). Measures suggested and implemented at the Ebre Delta in Spain include regular surveys and monitoring, raising public awareness, mitigation of damage to rice fields, control of salt pan levels and wardening against disturbance (Curcóet al. 2009).",,

In addition northern breeding populations are fully migratory (Matheu et al. 2014) and may travel on a broad front (e.g. across the Sahara) (Brown et al. 1982). Northern and southern breeding populations breed during the local spring, whilst breeding elsewhere coincides with the rains (Matheu et al. 2014). The species nests in mixed-species colonies, either in small groups (Brown et al. 1982) or in large aggregations of thousands of pairs, and during the winter or dry seasons the species usually forages in small flocks (Hancock et al. 1992, Matheu et al. 2014) of up to 30 individuals (Brown et al. 1982). It often roosts communally at night in large groups (sometimes thousands of individuals) with other species, occasionally in trees far from wetland feeding sites (Brown et al. 1982). The species feeds in very shallow water (Hancock et al. 1992) and nests in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes) and low trees or bushes (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Matheu et al. 2014). It shows a preference for marshes at the edges of lakes and rivers (Hancock et al. 1992), as well as lagoons, flood-plains, wet meadows (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Matheu et al. 2014), swamps (Matheu et al. 2014), reservoirs (Hancock et al. 1992), sewage ponds, rice-fields and irrigated cultivation (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Matheu et al. 2014). It less often occurs in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, saltmarshes (Hancock et al. 1992) and coastal lagoons (Matheu et al. 2014). Roosting sites are often large trees that may be far from water (Brown et al. 1982, Matheu et al. 2014). The diet of the species varies seasonally depending on what is available (Hancock et al. 1992). It takes adult and larval insects (e.g. aquatic beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and caddisflies), worms, leeches, molluscs (e.g. snails and mussels), crustaceans (e.g. crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish, frogs, tadpoles, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds (Matheu et al. 2014).The nest is a platform of twigs and vegetation usually positioned less than one metre above water (occasionally up to seven metres) in tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes), low trees or bushes over water (Matheu et al. 2014).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Snow and Perrins 1998, Matheu et al. 2014) through drainage (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hancock et al. 1992) for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002), clearing, grazing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It is also threatened locally by hunting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Matheu et al. 2014), disturbance and pesticides (Matheu et al. 2014), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).Conservation Actions ProposedMeasure should: Sustainably manage river valleys and wet grasslands; Abandonment of pastoral grassland, afforestation of farmland and drainage of wet meadows and inland wetlands in key breeding areas should be stopped.",,

The wild population in Birecik, Turkey, declined from 3,000 birds in 1930 to 400 in 1982 and was declared extinct by 1989 (Akcakaya et al. 1992), mainly as a result of poisoning by pesticides, loss of feeding habitat due to agricultural intensification, and human disturbance at the colonies, probably as well hunting pressures especially during migration.","This species inhabits arid and semi-arid plains and plateaux with rocky escarpments as well as cultivated fields and formerly high-altitude meadows or pastures. It roosts and nests in cliffs, adjacent to watercourses or along the sea coast. It is also found nesting on man-made structures such as castles, walls and towers (Matheu et al. 2014). Breeding begins February to March and finishes late June or early July, however dispersal does not start until August (Cramp et al. 1977). It breeds in colonies of up to 40 pairs. Nests are a loose platform of branches lined with grass, straw, wool, rags and other rubbish. Clutch size is usually two to four eggs (Bowden et al. 2003, Matheu et al. 2014). It feeds on invertebrates such as beetles, snails, scorpions and vertebrates such as amphibians, lizards and snakes, and occasionally even small rodents. Its broad high protein diet also includes some vegetation such as berries, shoots, duckweed, and rhizomes of aquatic plants (Hancock et al. 1992, Bowden et al. 2003). The population is mainly migratory.","It has declined at least for several centuries, perhaps partly owing to unidentified natural causes. However, the more recent rapid decline was undoubtedly the result of a combination of factors, including land-use change and agricultural intensification (Akçakaya 1990, Bowden et al. 2008, Collar and Stuart 1985). In Turkey, a major historical threat was poisoning and reduced breeding success caused by pesticides (DDT) used against locusts and mosquitoes (Murdoch 2010). Human disturbance (building development) at nest sites was also an important driver of decline in Turkey (Akçakaya 1990). Electrocution by powerlines and poorly designed electricity pylons pose a threat to the population in Birecik, as well as to the Central Europe and Spanish release projects (Fritz and Unsöld 2013, Serra et al. 2013).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. In 1999 an International Advisory Group (IAGNBI) was created to coordinate efforts and provide scientific advice (Bowden 2001,www.iagnbi.org). An International Species Action Plan was published in 2006. In Turkey hunting of the species is prohibited and 180 hectares of habitat in Birecik was designated as “Wildlife Improvement Area” in 2011. The management plan has been prepared and waiting for approval (Bowden, C. in litt. 2015). Over 2,000 individuals of the western (Morocco) population exist in captivity worldwide but birds from the eastern population are much rarer in captivity (very small numbers held in Turkish zoos [Böhm 2004]). A European Endangered species captive breeding Programme (EEP) was initiated in 1988 (Boehm and Bowden 2010). An in situ breeding programme at Birecik, Turkey has established a partially captive population of c. 190 birds and a number of unsuccessful trial releases of small numbers of birds have taken place since 2007 (Boehm & Bowden 2010, Serra et al. 2014). Most released birds were tagged or satellite tagged and colour-ringing of young birds at Birecik is ongoing (J. Tavares in litt. 2007, Hatipoglu 2010). Reintroduction programmes have focused on developing methodology, and are underway in Austria and Spain (also involving Germany and Italy) (UNEP/CMS 2008, Fritz 2010, Boehm and Bowden 2010). These trials have more recently evolved into reintroduction efforts on site in each case. In Cádiz, southwestern Spain, a total of 190 birds were released between 2004 and 2009 (Boehm and Bowden 2010). Although juvenile mortality was been high, the first breeding pair was formed on nearby cliffs in 2008 and a small independent non-migratory colony is becoming well established in the area (Matheu et al. 2014). There have been experimental field studies of the feeding ecology of hand-raised individuals in potential summer and winter habitat in Europe (Zoufal et al. 2006). In Austria, a small migratory breeding colony has been established and a European LIFE+ project is in place aiming to establish three self-sustaining breeding colonies north of the Alps by the end of 2019 (http://waldrapp.eu/). In Turkey, efforts have focused on increasing the semi-wild population through better husbandry, and now awareness-raising activities are ongoing, targeting locals and particularly farmers, focusing on the ecological importance of the species and the negative effects of using pesticides (Hatipoglu 2009, Bowden, C. in litt. 2015).Conservation Actions ProposedExplore the possibility of conservation translocation and reintroduction of captive-bred birds into previously occupied sites (when detailed information on ecological requirements is available) (Mendelssohn 1994, Brindley et al. 1995, Bowden 2001, Bowden, C. in litt. 2015). Research feasibility of re-establishing wild (preferably migratory) population in Turkey (J. Tavares in litt. 2007). A similar project in Syria has initiated a research and protection programme in collaboration with local communities and better links between the Birecik and Syrian populations and projects could be established; research potential to supplement Syrian colony with birds from Turkey (J. Tavares in litt. 2007, Serra et al. 2009, Bowden et al. 2012). Continue with current husbandry at Birecik to increase colony to 150-200 birds (J. Tavares in litt. 2007). Continue to monitor numbers and breeding success (Bowden et al. 2003). Protect key breeding and roosting sites from disturbance and development (Bowden et al. 2003), making sure to involve local people (Serra et al. 2009). Raise awareness among hunters on the migration route (Anon. 2006). Protect wintering areas in Ethiopia. Conduct research into feeding and breeding biology, and habitat requirements (Brindley et al. 1995). Employ management techniques such as the provision of drinking water (Smith et al. 2009, Serra et al. 2009). Common Raven (Corvus corax) populations around breeding sites should be controlled where they are identified as causing significant nest predation (Serra et al. 2009).",,

In the north of its range the species breeds in the local spring (e.g. from April). The species usually nests in monospecific colonies or in small monospecific groups amidst mixed-species colonies (Matheu et al. 2014). When not breeding the species forages singly or in small flocks (Matheu et al. 2014) of up to 100 individuals (Hancock et al. 1992) and migrates in flocks of up to 100 individuals (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is most active during the morning and evening (although in coastal areas it forages at low tide regardless of the time of day) (Hancock et al. 1992), and often roosts communally up to 15 km away from feeding areas (Brown et al. 1982). The species shows a preference for extensive shallow (Matheu et al. 2014) (less than 30 cm deep) wetlands with mud, clay or fine sand substrates, generally avoiding waters with rocky substrates, thick vegetation or swift currents (Hancock et al. 1992). It inhabits either fresh, brackish or saline (Hancock et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) marshes, rivers, lakes and flooded areas, especially those with islands for nesting or dense emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) and scattered trees or shrubs (Matheu et al. 2014) (preferably willow (Salix spp.), oak (Quercus spp.) or poplar (Populus spp.)) (Hancock et al. 1992). It may also frequent sheltered marine habitats during the winter such as deltas, estuaries, tidal creeks and coastal lagoons (Hancock et al. 1992, Matheu et al. 2014). Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (such as waterbeetles, dragonflies, caddisflies, locusts and flies), molluscs, crustaceans, worms, leeches, frogs, tadpoles and small fish (Matheu et al. 2014) up to 10–15 cm long (Hancock et al. 1992). It may also take algae or small fragments of aquatic plants (Matheu et al. 2014) (although these are possibly ingested accidentally with animal matter) (Hancock et al. 1992).The nest is a platform of sticks and vegetation constructed on the ground on islands in lakes and rivers, or alternatively in dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) (Matheu et al. 2014), bushes or deciduous trees (such as willow, oak or poplar) (Hancock et al. 1992) up to five metres above the ground (Matheu et al. 2014). The species nests in colonies within which neighbouring nests are usually placed one or two metres apart or touching (Hancock et al. 1992). Breeding colonies are sited within 10–15 km of feeding areas, often much less (although the species may also feed up to 35–40 km away) (Hancock et al. 1992).","The species is threatened by habitat degradation through drainage and pollution (Matheu et al. 2014) (e.g. chlorinated hydrocarbons) (Hancock et al. 1992), and is especially affected by the disappearance of reed swamps due to agricultural and hydroelectric development (Hancock et al. 1992). Over-fishing and disturbance have caused population declines in Greece (Hancock et al. 1992), and human exploitation of eggs and nestlings for food has threatened the species in the past (Hancock et al. 1992, Matheu et al. 2014). Poaching and collisions with overhead electricity cables are the main non-natural causes of death during migration (Triplet et al. 2008). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed in Appendix II of CITES, Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).

Within Europe the populations are fully migratory (Elliott et al. 2014) and travel via important stop-over sites (Nelson 2005). The species is entirely piscivorous, and in Europe it prefers carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Elliott et al. 2014)","The species is threatened by habitat destruction through drainage (Crivelli et al. 1991, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005, Elliott et al. 2014), the divergence of rivers for irrigation (Johnsgard 1993), agriculture development and industry (Elliott et al. 2014). It is also subject to climatic fluctuations that have a strong influence over water-levels in wetlands: floods leading to the inundation of nesting sites (Elliott et al. 2014) and lowering water-levels leading to the death of fish due to increased water salinity (Crivelli 1994). The species is threatened by persecution (Johnsgard 1993, Elliott et al. 2014) and hunting for sport because of its (minimal) depredation of fish from fish-farms (Crivelli et al. 1991, Kostadinova et al. 2007). It also suffers mortality due to collisions with electric powerlines during migration, dispersal or on its wintering grounds and is often found drowned in fishing nets (Crivelli et al. 1991). Disturbance (Elliott et al. 2014), (e.g., from tourism) threatens breeding colonies (Crivelli et al. 1991), and pesticides, heavy metal contamination and disease could have devastating effects on large colonies in the future (Crivelli et al. 1991, Elliott et al. 2014).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed under Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species; Appendix II of the Bern Convention; Annex I of the Birds Directive.

Typically winters on ice-free lakes in Europe (Elliot et al. 2014). It starts to breed in late March and April (Elliot et al. 2014), sometimes solitarily but usually in dense colonies of up to 250 pairs ( Cramp et al. 1977, Elliot et al. 2014). Adults form monogamous pair bonds (Mix and Bräunlich 2000). It leaves the colonies between the end of July and September, although a few remain until November (Nelson 2005). It is gregarious during the winter, often occurring in large flocks and foraging communally and cooperatively in small groups (Cramp et al. 1977).  Immature birds and non-breeders may remain in the wintering grounds year round (Nelson 2005), or may stay with the breeding colonies (Cramp et al. 1977).Birds return to the breeding sites in late-January to April, depending on the region (Nelson 2005). It breeds on small islands in freshwater lakes or in dense aquatic vegetation such as reedbeds (Crivelli 1994, Peja et al. 1996, Pyrovetsi 1997, Elliot et al. 2014), often in hilly terrain (Nelson 2005). A few breed in Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Peja et al. 1996, Nelson 2005). Nests typically consist of a pile of reeds, grass and sticks approximately 1 m high and 0.5–1.5 m in diameter (Nelson 2005, Elliot et al. 2014). They are usually situated amongst aquatic vegetation on floating or stationary islands isolated from the mainland to avoid mammalian predators (Crivelli 1994, Peja et al. 1996, Pyrovetsi 1997) but occasionally may be built on open ground (Hatzilacou 1993, Hatzilacou 1999, Nelson 2005). Artificial islands may also be used for nesting (Pyrovetsi 1997, S. Bugariu in litt. 2012). It feeds almost entirely on fish (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is dispersive in Europe, moving only short distances typically within the eastern Mediterranean (Elliott et al. 2014).","Former declines were primarily caused by wetland drainage, shooting and persecution by fishers (Crivelli 1994, Crivelli et al. 1997, Mix and Bräunlich 2000). Cases of illegal shooting are still reported (e.g. four shootings in 2009 in the Danube Delta, B. Barov in litt. 2009). Other continuing threats include disturbance from tourists and fishers, wetland alteration and destruction, water pollution, collision with overhead power-lines and over-exploitation of fish stocks (Crivelli et al. 1999, Hatzilacou 1993, Mix and Bräunlich 2000). Organochloride residues including DDT have been recorded in high levels in the eggs of this species and those of its prey (Albanis et al. 1995). Nest predation by wild boar at times of low water levels is the most important threat to the Bulgarian breeding colony (N. Petkov in litt. 2007). The breeding colonies in Mediterranean lagoons in Albania and Turkey are threatened by coastal developments and the alteration of the functioning of the lagoons (Peja et al. 1996).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II. Conservation efforts have reduced the impact of the major threats in Europe (Crivelli et al. 1997). Marking and dismantling of power-lines (Crivelli et al. 1997), the provision of breeding platforms in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania and rafts in Greece and Bulgaria, together with wardening (Hatzilacou 1999), water level management and education programmes at key sites, have reduced mortality and increased breeding success.

Some breeding populations (e.g. in Spain) are also sedentary (Elliott et al. 2014). The species is a solitary nester, the timing of breeding varying between populations but generally coinciding with spring in the Palearctic Region (Elliott et al. 2014). On migration the species may travel singly (Snow and Perrins 1998) or in small groups (Elliott et al. 2014) of up to 100 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998), and on its wintering grounds it is normally observed singly or in small groups of less than 30 individuals (Brown et al. 1982). The species inhabits old, undisturbed, open forests (Snow and Perrins 1998, Elliott et al. 2014) from sea-level up to mountainous regions (e.g. 2,000–2,500 m in altitude) (Hancock et al. 1992). It forages in shallow streams, pools, marshes (Elliott et al. 2014), swampy patches (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Hancock et al. 1992), flood-plains, pools in dry riverbeds (Hockey et al. 2005) and occasionally grasslands (Elliott et al. 2014) especially where there are stands of reeds or long grass (Brown et al. 1982). It generally avoids large bodies of water and dense forest (Elliott et al. 2014), but non-breeding birds may frequent the estuaries of tidal rivers (Hancock et al. 1992). It is predominantly piscivorous although it may also take amphibians, insects, snails, crabs, small reptiles, mammals and birds. The nest is a large construction of sticks (Elliott et al. 2014) positioned between 4–25 m high (Hancock et al. 1992) in large forest trees (Lohmus and Sellis 2003, Elliott et al. 2014) or on cliffs (Spain) (Elliott et al. 2014). The species shows a preference for nesting in trees that have canopies large enough to hold the nest away from the main trunk (e.g. trees 25 m high, 120 years old and with a diameter at breast height of 66 cm) (Lohmus and Sellis 2003). It nests solitarily, with pairs spread out in the landscape at a distance of no less than one kilometre (even where the species is most numerous) (Hancock et al. 1992). The species may occupy the nests of other bird species and commonly reuses nests in successive years (Elliott et al. 2014).","The main threat to this species is habitat degradation (Hancock et al. 1992, Balian et al. 2002, Lohmus and Sellis 2003, Diagana et al. 2006, Elliott et al. 2014). The area of suitable habitat available for breeding is being reduced in Russia and eastern Europe through deforestation (Elliott et al. 2014) (particularly the destruction of large traditional nesting trees) (Hancock et al. 1992, Lohmus and Sellis 2003), the rapid development of industry and farming (Hancock et al. 1992), the building of dams (Diagana et al. 2006) and lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002).The species's wetland wintering habitats in Africa are further threatened by conversion (Elliott et al. 2014), agricultural intensification, desertification and pollution caused by the concentration of pesticides and other chemicals (Diagana et al. 2006, Elliott et al. 2014). The species is also occasionally killed by collisions with power-lines and overhead cables (Hockey et al. 2005), and hunting in southern Europe (especially during migration) has caused population declines (Hancock et al. 1992).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) and on Annex II of the Cites Convention. Wetlands International has published a Conservation Action Plan for the species in Africa, focusing on the wintering conditions of the birds breeding in Europe (Diagana et al. 2006).Conservation Actions ProposedA study in Estonia found that the retention of large older trees during forest management is important in providing nesting sites for the species (Lohmus and Sellis 2003). Conservation measures aimed at increasing the species's breeding success and population density should cover large territories of predominantly deciduous woodland and should focus on managing the river quality as far as 20 km away from nesting sites, protecting and managing feeding habitats, and improving food resources by establishing shallow artificial pools in grasslands or along rivers (Jiguet and Villarubias 2004). Other measures should: Monitor breeding, migrating, wintering numbers, age composition and ecological changes at key sites; Sustainably manage rivers and small streams; Establish non-intrusion zones around nest locations; Protect nesting trees (also in plantations) and rocks; Bury power-lines or replace with more visible cable; Prevent poaching and overexploitation of fish.",,

This species is a Palearctic migrant (Elliott et al. 2014) that travels with the assistance of thermal updrafts, the occurrence of which restricts the migratory routes the species can take (Hancock et al. 1992). It breeds from February to April in the Palearctic (Elliott et al. 2014). It nests in loose colonies of up to 30 pairs (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014) or solitarily (Elliott et al. 2014). The main departure from the European breeding grounds occurs in August (Hancock et al. 1992) with the species travelling in large flocks (Brown et al. 1982, Hancock et al. 1992), generally arriving in Africa by early October (Brown et al. 1982). The species inhabits open areas, shallow marshes, lakesides (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014), lagoons (Elliott et al. 2014), flood-plains, rice-fields and arable land (Snow and Perrins 1998) especially where there are scattered trees for roosting (Elliott et al. 2014). It generally avoids regions with persistent cold, wet weather or large tracts of tall, dense vegetation such as reedbeds or forests (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014). During the winter the species shows a preference for drier habitats (Hancock et al. 1992) such as grasslands, steppe and cultivated fields (Elliott et al. 2014), often gathering near lakes, ponds (Hancock et al. 1992), pools, slow-flowing streams, ditches (Elliott et al. 2014) or rivers (Hancock et al. 1992). The species is carnivorous and has a varied and opportunistic diet. It takes small mammals (Elliott et al. 2014) (e.g., voles, water voles, mice, shrews, young rats (Hancock et al. 1992)), large insects (e.g. beetles, grasshoppers, crickets and locusts), adult and juvenile amphibians, snakes, lizards, earthworms, fish (Elliott et al. 2014), eggs and nestlings of ground-nesting birds, molluscs and crustaceans (Hancock et al. 1992). The nest is constructed of sticks (Elliott et al. 2014) and is commonly positioned up to 30 m above the ground (Brown et al. 1982) in trees or on the roofs of buildings, as well as on pylons, telegraph poles, stacks of straw and other anthropogenic sites (including specially erected nesting structures), cliffs and occasionally among rushes on the ground (Elliott et al. 2014). The species nests solitarily or in loose colonies, often using traditional nesting sites (there are records of individual nests being used every year for 100 years) (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014). Nesting sites are usually situated near foraging areas, but may be up to 2–3 km away (Snow and Perrins 1998).","The species is threatened by habitat alteration including the drainage of wet meadows (Goriup and Schulz 1990, Elliott et al. 2014), prevention of floods on flood-plains (by dams, embankments, pumping stations and river canalisation schemes) (Goriup and Schulz 1990), conversion of foraging areas (Elliott et al. 2014), development, industrialisation and intensification of agriculture (Hancock et al. 1992) (e.g. mechanised ploughing of rough pastures to sow fertilised crops or swards of more productive grass varieties) (Goriup and Schulz 1990). It is also threatened by a shortage of nesting sites in some areas (Elliott et al. 2014) as, for example, the roofs of new rural buildings do not support nests and nest structures on pylons are frequently destroyed during maintenance work (Goriup and Schulz 1990). The species may also suffer as a result of the excessive use of pesticides  (Elliott et al. 2014, Hockey et al. 2005) and through eating poisoned baits put out to catch large carnivores (Elliott et al. 2014). Another serious threat is collision with and electrocution from overhead powerlines (Bairlein 1991, Elliott et al. 2014), especially whilst on migration in Europe (Hancock et al. 1992). The species is hunted for food and sport (Elliott et al. 2014), mainly on migration (Hancock et al. 1992) and in its winter quarters (Goriup and Schulz 1990).","Conservation Actions UnderwayThis species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA). The eastern and western populations are currently listed in columns C (category 1) and A (category 3b) in the AEWA Action Plan, respectively. The international population of the species is censused and monitored every 10 years (Schulz 1999).Conservation Actions ProposedIntensively grazed (>1 cow per hectare) unfertilised grassland was found to attract a higher abundance of this species in Hungary (Baldi et al. 2005), and traditional livestock-farming practices such as creating herb-rich meadows for stock grazing and hay production are thought to be beneficial (Goriup and Schulz 1990). A model used to study the impact of different land use patterns on the species found that sequential (asynchronous) mowing of grasslands may increase the food supply for nestlings, thereby increasing reproductive success (as sequential mowing generates a small number of high-quality foraging patches throughout the breeding season) (Johst et al. 2001). A report by the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP) suggests that habitat management for the species should include the periodic flooding of meadows, the creation of a mosaic of native grasslands and meadows, and the retention or creation of ditches, ponds and lakes (Goriup and Schulz 1990). The report also advises management strategies in relation to electricity pylons (e.g. burying or marking aerial cables and preventing disturbance to nests during maintenance) to reduce the threats of electrocution and collision (Goriup and Schulz 1990). Due to the species's habit of defecating on its legs to regulate its body temperature in hot climates it is inadvisable to fit individuals with leg-rings for tracking purposes (dry uric acid builds-up on the legs and hardens around leg-rings, tightening them and leading to injuries) (Goriup and Schulz 1990). Other methods of monitoring movements such as satellite telemetry or patagial wing-tags are therefore advised (Goriup and Schulz 1990). Other measures should: Monitor breeding, migrating, wintering numbers, age composition and ecological changes at key sites and habitats; Sustainably manage river valleys and wet grasslands; Abandonment of pastoral grassland, afforestation of farmland and drainage of wet meadows and inland wetlands in key breeding areas should be stopped; Bury power-lines or replace with more visible cables.",,

Outside of the breeding season the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland (Carboneras et al. 2014) on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn (Carboneras et al. 2014), aquatic insects, annelid worms (Snow and Perrins 1998) and plant matter (Carboneras et al. 2014). In winter its diet is almost predominantly fish, and in the Baltic Sea they opportunistically feed on spawning Herring, Smelt and Percids.","When breeding the species is threatened by water level fluctuations and acidification of breeding waters heavy metal pollution and the afforestation of peatland or moorland habitats (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is also sensitive to human disturbance from recreational activities and shoreline development (e.g. construction work near breeding lakes) (Meek et al. 1993) and will desert sites if there is too much human activity (Carboneras et al. 2014). During the winter the species is highly vulnerable to coastal oil spills, especially in areas where large concentrations form (e.g. on rich fishing grounds) (Skov et al.2011, Carboneras et al. 2014). The North, Baltic and Mediterranean Seas have experienced severe oil spill events in the past, and remain regions at risks of future spills particularly with expanding oil exploration activity. This species is also highly sensitive to disturbance from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) during winter, causing a risk for habitat displacement and collision (Garthe and Huppop 2004, Bradbury et al. 2014). The species suffers mortality at sea and on large lakes due to entanglement and drowning in inshore gillnets (Carboneras et al. 2014), with potentially significant impacts on the breeding and wintering population within the Baltic Sea , where large numbers of birds overlap with intensive gillnet fisheries (Žydelis et al. 2013).  It is also highly sensitive to disturbance at sea, particularly from vessel traffic along shipping lanes, a particular problem in North Sea and the Baltic region due to high numbers of vessels passing (Schwemmer et al. 2011)  It is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).

Breeding dates are similar elsewhere in Europe. The nest is built by both sexes although the female does the majority of construction. It is made from sticks and twigs, with a side entrance protected by thorny twigs. A deep cup is thickly lined with soft materials such as wool, animal fur, soft grasses and feathers, usually placed at variable height in crown of tall tree; normally a fresh nest built each year, although in some cases an old nest may be repaired. It is omnivorous but principally a carnivorous scavenger.

Coastal populations such as those found in Ireland, Britain, Brittany, Canaries, and north-west Spain, favour sea cliffs with rocky crags, interspersed with closely grazed grassland. Populations found further inland occur in high mountain pastures above the tree-line, favouring sheep-grazed slopes. The species is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond (Madge 2009).Egg-laying begins in March in Britain and in mid to late April in the Caucasus (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a mass of sticks, thickly lined with wool, rarely all wool and built typically in the roof of a cave, rock chimney, or disused quarry, but also uses roof spaces of disused buildings, old mine shafts or similar sites. Clutches are usually four eggs. It is chiefly insectivorous, particulary in spring and summer, but also feeds on a wide variety of other invertebrates and rarely on small vertebrates such as lizards (Lacertidae) and small mammals. In autumn and winter, when invertebrate food more difficult to find, it takes grain, seeds and small berries, including those of rowan (Sorbus), pear (Pyrus), juniper (Juniperus), sea-buckthorn (Hippophae) and olive (Olea). The species is essentially sedentary (Madge 2009).","The most important cause of declines in the species is changes in grazing regimes (Madge 2009) and conversion of grazing habitat to forestry, tourist-related developments or intensive farming (Tucker and Heath 1994). Historically, grazing animals roamed freely over mountain slopes and coastal cliffs, keeping vegetation short and ideal for invertebrates (Madge 2009). In the Alps, it is thought competition with Alpine Chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus) and Eurasian Jackdaw (Corvus monedula) may be detrimental to the species (Madge and Burn 1993). The species has also suffered from persecution (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and they were shot for sport during the 19th and 20th centuries (Wilmore 1977). The conversion of grazing land to arable may also be a threat to this species (Bibby et al. 1989).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I.

It generally occupies more open habitat in the south and north portions of range where cliffs, sparse trees provide nest locations. In middle latitudes it is generally found in coniferous and broadleaf forests, where tree-nesting often more common than cliff-nesting (Marzluff 2009).Egg-laying begins in late February over most of its range, although further north in Greenland and Siberia it begins later in April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a large and bulky platform, made from dead sticks, lined with fine roots, grass, string and other bits of rubbish, and with mammal fur to make an inner cup. It is placed in the stout, lower branches of a tree, on a steep cliff, or on an artificial structure such as a utility pole, building, sign, radio tower, abandoned vehicle, oil derrick, bridge, irrigation pipe or windmill. Clutch size is typically four to six eggs. It is an opportunistic scavenger, consuming a huge variety of animals and plants. It preys on adult and nestling birds, eggs, small mammals, sick and dying larger mammals, toads, snakes, juvenile turtles, fish and invertebrates. It also scavenges garbage and slaughterhouse offal, dung, and nearly any kind of carrion and some plant matter is also consumed (Marzluff 2009).

",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Corsica, France. It has a limited and fragmented breeding range which follows the distribution of Corsican pine Pinus nigra laricio, occurring on inland mountain ridges from Tartagine south to Ospedale and Mt Cagna, with the main populations focussed around the mountains of Cinto, Rotondo, Renoso and Incudine (Harrap and de Juana 2013).","The European population is estimated at 1,500-2,200 pairs, which equates to 3,000-4,400 mature individuals. The entire population is found in the EU27. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","Optimal habitat for this species is mature stands of Corsican pine with abundant dead and rotting trunks for nest sites, at elevations of 1,000-1,500 m (Harrap and de Juana 2013). Densities vary between 0.2–3.8 pairs/10 ha, and correlate with tree height, vegetation density and dead tree distribution (Thibault and Bonaccorsi 1999). Suboptimal habitats include forests where Corsican pine is associated with cluster pine (Pinus pinaster), balsam fir (Abies alba) or beech (Fagus sylvatica), and younger, exploited stands of Corsican pine at elevations of 600–1,700 m. Dispersing birds may be found in holm oak (Quercus ilex) and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) forests, gardens and orchards (Thibault and Bonaccorsi 1999, Harrap and de Juana 2013). Its breeding season stretches from April to May, laying a clutch of five to six eggs, with mated partners remaining on their territory all year. It feeds largely on insects and spiders during May-August, switching to seeds, especially those of the Corsican pine, during the rest of the year. It forages singly or in pairs, though may join mixed-species flocks outside the breeding season. Seeds are cached from late autumn to early spring during periods of sunny weather (when the cones are open) and retrieved during wet or cold weather (Harrap and de Juana 2013). It is generally sedentary except for some dispersal of immature and unmated birds to lower altitudes in winter (Thibault and Bonaccorsi 1999).","Forest fires and logging of mature Corsican pine stands appear to be the primary threats to this species. Large trees suitable for the species are also favoured by the logging industry and since the 1970s local foresters have attempted to rejuvenate the pine forest by shortening the logging rotation, reducing the size of trees available for the species (Bourcet 1996). It has been estimated that 78-122 territories have been destroyed by logging since 1998, and that a further 50-63 territories were lost during the large forest fires of 2000 and 2003, which severely affected another 47-80 territories (Thibault et al. 2004, 2010). It has been predicted that whenever an area 2 ha is logged in a forest stand suitable for the species, a potential territory is likely to disappear for more than a century due to the slow growth of Corsican Pine (Thibault et al. 2010). This species is potentially susceptible to climate change through sea-level rise and shifts in suitable climatic conditions (affecting Corsican pine distribution), however this is not expected to be a serious direct threat (Barbet-Massin and Jiguet 2011, BirdLife International unpublished data). Climate change may also cause an increase in fire frequency and intensity and so could be a serious future threat to the species (J.Baudat-Franceschi in litt. 2010, Barbet-Massin and Jiguet 2011). Climate change may increase interspecific competition between Corsican pine and Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) as well as Mediterranean shrub species which in turn could have a negative effect on the species's range (Thibault et al. 2010, J. Baudat-Franceschi in litt. 2012).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I.

In Turkey, it occurs mostly between 1,000–1,600 m, mainly in forests of black pine (Pinus nigra), fir (Abies cilicica), cedar (Cedrus libani), red pine (Pinus brutia) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) (Albayrak et al. 2006, T. Albayrak in litt. 2007). In the Caucasus, it occurs mainly in the zone of spruce (Picea) forests between 1,000 and 2,000 m, mostly in old stands of Caucasian fir (Abies nordmanniana), but also in pine (Pinus) forest. The breeding season is from early April to mid-May (depending on altitude and locality) on Lesbos and in Turkey and April to May in Caucasus. The nest is built largely by the female and is a foundation of coarse bark chips, rotten wood and cone scales, lined with a pad of moss, bark fibres, hair, wool, fur and feathers. Nests are built up to 24 m above ground in tree holes although eggs are sometimes laid on top of a stump or even in pile of twigs in a fork (perhaps only when holes not available). It feeds largely on insects and spiders in the breeding season and chicks are fed entirely on animal material. In autumn and winter it feeds on the seeds of coniferous trees and will cache food for times of poor weather (Harrap 2008). The species is primarily sedentary but some altitudinal movement occurs in the winter (Tucker and Heath 1994).","In Turkey, forestry is placing considerable pressure on the species's mature coniferous forest habitats (T. Albayrak in litt. 2007). Development for tourism is also a threat, particularly in coastal areas where the species was once numerous (S. Isfendiyaroglu in litt. 2005).

It is also found in riverine woodland, scrub heathland with scattered trees, bushes and hedges in farmland and well-wooded suburban parks, cemeteries and gardens. In the Mediterranean it also uses maquis and open pine (Pinus) forest. Otherwise, avoids pure stands of conifers in west of range, but noted in open forests of spruce (Picea), fir (Abies), larch (Larix) and Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica) in central Siberia.It breeds from mid-March to June.

It is lined with small feathers and adults may continue to add feathers during laying period. It is usually found in a low thorny bush, but a few are built up in tree fork or against a trunk, or hanging among terminal twigs of conifer (Harrap 2008). Normally eight to twelve eggs are laid. It feeds mainly on arthropods although plant matter is taken occasionally during autumn and winter. The species is resident in temperate and Mediterranean areas, but irruptive movements occur farther north (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Declines in Sweden and Finland are likely as a result of modern forestry practices and the replacement of old-growth habitats with commercial monocultures. During the winter flocks require large territories and habitat fragmentation and degradation can thus threaten local populations. It is vulnerable to severe winters, which can cause numbers to decline by up to 80% and it can take years for populations to recover. Reproductive success can be suppressed by predation of nests, most commonly by crows (Corvidae), weasels (Mustela) and snakes (Harrap 2008).",Conservation Actions UnderwayThere are currently no known conservation measures for this species.Conservation Actions ProposedA wide-scale approach to the preservation of suitable habitat for this species is important.

Quarries are important nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and birds may use other man-made habitats including road and railway cuttings and building work excavations. Breeding occurs between late April and August usually with two clutches of between three and six eggs. Burrows are excavated by both male and female but male initiates the process. Erosion at breeding sites is vital for creating new nest sites which birds prefer. Sand martins may roost in reedbeds. They forage approximately 15 m above ground (Turner 2004) feeding mainly on insects but also taking spiders (Tucker & Heath 1994, Turner 2004). Important foraging habitats include water-bodies, grassland and farmland (Turner 2004). Urban and forested areas are less important. This species is migratory with Eurasian birds typically wintering in the Sahel zone and East Africa south to Mozambique (Tucker and Heath 1994). Adult birds migrate soon after breeding. Juveniles roam over a wide area. Most adult birds return to the same breeding colony in subsequent years (Turner 2004).","Breeding sites are generally ephemeral and can often be lost through human activities (e.g. flood control, erosion control on rivers). In Europe, it is often dependent on artificial breeding sites such as quarries (Turner 2004), however quarry work can adversely affect breeding, though workers often take measures to prevent this. The use of pesticides causing declines in prey species, may impact the species (Tucker and Heath 1994). In the past droughts in wintering areas have caused severe large-scale population declines in western Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Turner 2004).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II.

Flood alteration schemes should also be managed to provide breeding areas (Tucker and Heath 1994).

In addition, intensive livestock rearing, improved hygiene, land drainage and the use of herbicides and pesticides all reduce the numbers of insect prey available. Suitable nest sites are often scarcer on modern farms. The species is susceptible to changes in climate with bad weather in the wintering areas as well as the breeding grounds affecting breeding success (Tucker and Heath 1994).

Lachmann in litt. 2007, U. Malashevich in litt. 2012). On migration, it has been recorded in c.15 European countries, mainly in the west and southwest of the continent (U. Malashevich in litt. 2012). It winters in the Sahelian belt of sub-Saharan West Africa, mainly along the lower Senegal River (Bargain et al. 2008, Flade 2008, U. Malashevich in litt. 2012). The Hungarian population has collapsed and the tiny West Siberian population has probably already disappeared, in which case the species has become a European endemic breeder (M. Flade and L. Lachmann in litt. 2007).","The European population is estimated at 9,000-13,800 calling or lekking males, which equates to 18,000-27,600 mature individuals.

For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species breeds in large open lowland marsh habitats with low grassy vegetation (mostly sedge fen mires) with water mostly less than 10 cm deep (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999). On migration, it favours coastal habitats with low stands of sedge and reed near open water (Flade et al. 2011). The species has an unusual reproductive system close to promiscuity, the female raising young without male help. This strategy is possibly explained and facilitated by high density of potential prey (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Nests are often concentrated in loose clusters at places where food resources are rich. The nest is a cup constructed of grass, plant stems and leaves, spider webs and plant down and lined with finer material, placed 3–30 cm above swampy ground or water, often under roof of dead sedges. Clutch size ranges from three to six eggs. In studies in north-east Poland, the earliest clutch started 9th May and the mean first-egg date in consecutive years was between 15th and 22nd May. Second broods are less synchronous. It feeds on a wide variety of species of spiders and insects as well as small water snails (Dyrcz et al. 2013). The species is migratory. Central European populations migrate south-west in the autumn to wintering grounds in western Sahelian wetlands, from Senegal and Mali to Ghana, but extent of wintering area poorly known (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Departure from breeding grounds begins in Poland in late July and continues during August (Dyrcz et al. 2013).","The most important threats are loss of breeding habitat owing to drainage for agriculture and peat extraction, damming of floodplains, unfavourable water management and the canalisation of rivers. Habitat degradation is widespread where traditional fen management has ceased allowing succession to unsuitable overgrown reedbed, scrub or woodland (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999). Commercial reed cutting can maintain suitable breeding habitat for the species in central Europe, but this is threatened by changes that are likely to occur along with the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (Tanneberger et al. 2009). Uncontrolled fires in spring and summer pose a direct threat to birds and nests, and can burn out the upper peat layer of fens (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999). In the wintering grounds, agricultural cultivation and irrigation, drought, wetland drainage, intensive grazing, succession to scrub, desertification and salinisation of irrigated soils are all potential threats (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999, M. Flade and L. Lachmann in litt. 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. EU Birds Directive Annex I.

In the Mediterranean basin it selects areas with average shrub height of 50 cm and bare ground c. 60% and it often prefers saltmarshes with glasswort (Salicornia) in the winter (de Juana and Suárez 2004). Egg-laying occurs from April to June, although begins in March in the Canary Islands (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a small scrape on the ground beside a small shrub or tuft, or in the open and lined with vegetation. Normally three to four eggs are laid.

In Spain it prefers land with shrubs, mainly 40–60 cm tall, and medium-high percentage of bare ground. It also occurs in cereal fields outside the breeding season. It is found between 50–1,550 m, but mostly at 1,000–1,400 m. Breeding takes place in March and July and pairs will often have more than one brood. Song-flighting males often rise to considerable height (100–150 m) and remain aloft, singing continuously, for 30 minutes or more before suddenly descending rapidly and vertically to the ground; wing-clapping has been recorded during song flights at lower levels. The nest is a scrape on ground, beside a small shrub or tuft or in the open, lined with twigs, vegetable fibres and hair, orientation mainly in NE-NW quarter. Clutch size three to five eggs in Spain (de Juana and Suárez 2004). The species feeds principally on insects (beetles and Lepidoptera larvae) and seeds. The chicks are fed only on invertebrates, predominantly Lepidoptera larvae, grasshoppers (Acrididae) and spiders (Tucker and Heath 1994). This species is sedentary although probably irregular movements occur during winter. In Spain, it has been observed in winter flocks with other lark species. Vagrants recorded east and north in Italy, Malta, Greece (Crete) and Cyprus (de Juana and Suárez 2004).","In parts of its range, overgrazing or undergrazing and agricultural development have caused a reduction in its preferred habitats and a considerable decrease in numbers (M. Smart in litt. 2004, Isenmann et al. 2005). Reforestation schemes also lead to a loss of suitable habitat and infrastructure development has led to fragmentation of habitat, particularly by the construction and development of windfarms in Spain. The limited dispersal capabilities of the species reduces the exchange of individuals between populations and increases their extinction risk. Since gene flow between Iberian and African populations is extremely low (García et al. 2008 ) it is important that conservation plans for Iberian populations do not rely on the existence of the African populations of the same subspecies. A recent Spanish study has shown that the species's occurrence is principally determined by geographic isolation (extinction events were exclusively related to isolation), landscape matrix and patch size, rather than habitat quality (Vögeli et al. 2010). Isolation of local populations and reduced patch size has a compounding effect on population density since smaller populations suffer reduced singing repertoires which in turn reduces the rescuing effect from others (receiving immigrants), thus compromising population persistence (Laiolo and Tella 2008).",Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I.

In the Canary Islands it is found in laurel (Lauraceae) forest and areas of dense vegetation (Clement 2010). Egg-laying occurs mainly from late-April to mid-July but clutches can be found from mid-March to mid-July (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is placed up to 35 m above ground on a branch, against a trunk or in the fork of a tree or bush. It is a deep cup made of plant fibres, grass, fine roots, lichens, moss, bark strips, animal hair and feathers. Clutches are four to five eggs. The diet is varied and is mostly small invertebrates and their larvae, seeds and buds. The species is resident, partially migratory and migratory, with populations in the north and northeast moving south and southwest between mid-September and the end of November (Clement 2010).","Particularly in northern areas populations may fluctuate in response to weather conditions, with cold conditions resulting in temporary declines (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is trapped in some parts of its range. In the Canary Islands the race palmae is threatened by forest fires, wood harvesting and predation by introduced mammals, while race ombriosa is threatened by forest fires, wood harvesting and drought (Madroño and González 2004).","Conservation Actions UnderwayFringilla coelebs ombriosa is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. In the Canary Islands, both palmae and ombriosa have had much of their habitat protected as Natural and Special Protected Areas and the species has benefited from protection measures for other species (Madroño and González 2004).Conservation Actions ProposedAcross its range this species is not threatened, however the races palmae and ombriosa in the Canary Islands are threatened. It has been recommended that a management plan be produced for these races, in addition to research on reproductive success, impacts of introduced predators and habitat selection. Regular monitoring should also be carried out (Madroño and González 2004).",,

The taxon F. t. polatzeki of Gran Canaria is rare and highly threatened, but the area of suitable habitat on Tenerife (the majority of the range) is increasing overall, which suggests that the population is also increasing, and the range is not severely fragmented. However, forest fires remain a serious and plausible potential threat and have the potential to cause a rapid population decline which would warrant the species being uplisted to Vulnerable or Endangered. For this reason, the species is classified as Near Threatened (D2).Were appropriate action to be taken which reduces the risk of serious fires such that they no longer represent a plausible threat, the species may be eligible for downlisting to Least Concern in the future.",Increasing,"The species is found only on Tenerife (subspecies teydea) and Gran Canaria (subspecies polatzeki) in the Canary Islands, Spain (Clement 2010).","The European population is estimated at 1,100-2,600 pairs, which equates to 2,200-5,300 mature individuals.

During the breeding season, it is found in pinewoods at 1,000–2,000 m with a high proportion of broom (Chamaecytisus proliferus) in the understorey (Garcia-del-Rey et al. 2009). It has been recorded from 800 to 2,300 m at other times.The breeding season lasts from April to early August. The nest is built by the female mostly from pine twigs, tree-heath or broom, plant fibres and down, pine needles, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair, feathers and cobwebs. Generally it is placed up to 12 m above ground against trunk of Canary pine and sometimes in laurel or heather (Clement 2010). Two eggs are normally laid. Although Canary pine seeds constitute its main food source, birds occasionally feed outside pinewoods during severe weather. The species selects sheltered sites for feeding during the non-breeding period with the selection of less sheltered sites mediated by pine seed availability (Garcia-del-Rey et al. 2009). The species is resident although vagrants occur on Lanzarote in the east of the Canary Isles (Clement 2010).","It suffers from being captured and kept in cages, and possibly also still from illegal trade, primarily to Italy, Germany and Belgium, which may have an effect on population levels. Its pinewood habitat has been subject to intense commercial exploitation which has resulted in habitat fragmentation and population isolation, particularly on Gran Canaria. Forest fires have been important in the destruction of pinewoods on Gran Canaria, most recently in the summer of 2007 when significant areas were destroyed including one of the most important sites on Gran Canaria. Protected areas are heavily used for recreation and leisure on Gran Canaria and this may cause disturbance. Inbreeding may also be a significant threat in the Gran Canaria population (Barov and Derhé 2011). The main cause of breeding failure is predation, mostly by the Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) (Rodríguez and Moreno 2008).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II.

A conservation programme was initiated in 1991 and a captive breeding programme began in 1992. An action plan was published in 1996 (González 1996) and reviewed in 2004 (Nagy and Crockford 2004) and 2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). Captive breeding on Gran Canaria was started anew in 2005, and the first chicks were expected to be released in 2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). Fire prevention measures are implemented, particularly during the summer, and access to suitable habitat is limited on Gran Canaria. There is also an ongoing project that focusses on the restoration of fire-damaged pine forest on Gran Canaria. Control measures against alien species are being implemented on Tenerife and cats have been controlled on Gran Canaria since 1996. Research is being conducted into the potential threat of inbreeding in the population on Gran Canaria (Barov and Derhé 2011).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitoring and research should be continued and expanded. An official governmental action plan should be produced to detail conservation requirements such as habitat restoration, prevention of forest fires and eradication of illegal trade. In addition, the species should be included under CITES and adequate protection should be ensured under the Countryside Law and Wildlife Protection Law. Forest management should focus on thinning areas of dense pine trees (as in García-del-Rey et al. 2010) where no undergrowth persists and reafforesting areas within the former range of pine forests on the islands (García-del-Rey and Cresswell 2005).

In the northern part of its range it occurs mainly in cultivated land, preferring low-intensity, mixed farmland on light soils, with sparsely vegetated spots and scattered or lines of trees or bushes. In forested areas of Fenno-Scandinavia and Russia, it occupies forest margins, clearings and clear fells. In the southern areas of its breeding range it occurs in rugged open mountainous areas with some shrubs up to 2,400 m asl (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011, BirdLife International 2015).

It shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) with low banks (Flint et al. 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys or among mossy bogs (Flint et al. 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration the majority moult and overwinter at sea on shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs. The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) close to water or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005). Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter, although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans, worms (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), echinoderms, isopods, amphipods (Kear 2005) and insects as well as small fish (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter such as seeds, roots and tubers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint et al. 1984). This species is strongly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The large concentrations of this species that occur during the moulting period and in winter are highly vulnerable to oil spills (Gorski et al. 1977, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), chronic oil pollution, human disturbance and the degradation of food resources as a result of oil exploration (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). The species also suffers disturbance from high-speed ferries (Larsen and Laubek 2005) and populations wintering off the coasts of western Europe are threatened by offshore wind farms (Kear 2005, Fox and Petersen 2006, Petersen 2006). The effects of commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish also poses a threat (through competition for food resources), and the species's breeding habitats are threatened by eutrophication in some areas (Kear 2005). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).

Population models predict an extremely rapid decline over three generations (54 years), qualifying the species as Critically Endangered (A4bcde). However, this assumption was based on the existence of a population of c.2,000 breeding pairs, which could have been underestimated according to recent population estimates and records at sea, plus a recent re-evaluation of some colonies (i.e. increased accuracy in the estimates). Updated population viability analysis to re-evaluate the species's status is planned, incorporating recent population estimates and improved demographic data. Should this analysis reveal that the species is declining at a more moderate rate, this species will warrant downlisting.  ",Decreasing,"The species occurs in the western and central Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic Ocean. It breeds in the Balearic Islands, Spain (del Hoyo et al. 2014), with colonies present on Mallorca, Cabrera, Ibiza and Formentera (Arcos 2011).","The European population is estimated at 3,200 pairs, which equates to 6,400 mature individuals. The entire population is found in the EU27. For details of national estimates, see attached PDF.","This species is marine, usually found around inshore waters (del Hoyo et al. 2014). It breeds on cliffs and small islets and lays only one egg. Adult birds do not breed until their third year (Oro et al. 2004). Breeding occurs between February and June (Ruiz & Martí 2004). The species nests in colonies, in rock crevices or on cave ledges lined sparsely with plant material. It feeds mostly on small shoaling fish, squid and crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 2014). After breeding, most birds leave the Mediterranean for the Atlantic coast of south-west Europe, mainly Portugal, north-west Spain and the Bay of Biscay (Ruiz and Martí 2004, Ramírez et al. 2008, Arcos et al. 2009).","This is a long-lived species and therefore immediate threats affect adult mortality rates. Adult survival is the main conservation concern, as this is unusually low for a Procellariiform (Oro et al. 2004). In accordance, the main threats identified are predation by introduced carnivores such as cats, martens and genets in the breeding colonies (Arcos and Oro 2004, Ruiz and Martí 2004, Jones et al. 2008, Arcos 2011) and fisheries by-catch at sea (Arcos 2011). The species's gregarious behaviour and its close association with fishing boats means that occasional mass mortality is likely to occur when long-line boats fish close to flocks (Arcos et al. 2008) and it appears that bycatch is fairly common but often occurs on an irregular basis, suggesting that estimates derived from observations on a limited number of trips onboard fishing vessels could be largely underestimates (Boue et al. 2013). Increasing evidence on this has been compiled in the last few years, with events of up to a hundred or more birds caught in a single event, in occasions involving other fishing gear such as purse-seiners (ICES 2008, Louzao et al. 2011). Due to the congregatory behaviour of the species, acute pollution events such as oil spills also pose a very serious threat as a large number of casualties could result from a spill occurring in a congregation area (Ruiz and Martí 2004, Gutiérrez 2011). Other threats include: the reduction of prey due to fishing overexploitation; a potential reduction in fishing discards (an alternative to the overexploited natural prey) and/or anthropogenic environmental change (Arcos 2011); habitat degradation and disturbance in the breeding grounds; background pollution (Oro et al. 2008); the development of marine windfarms (Arcos 2011a); and human harvesting (nowadays a relict activity). Predation by Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) in the breeding colonies has also been recently reported (García 2009, Wynn et al. 2010), though this should be considered as a factor of natural mortality that likely has little influence on the decline of the species. The gradual northward movement of the non-breeding population may be affecting adult survival, and this shift may be due to climate change or alterations in fish distributions as a result of fisheries' activities (Yésou 2003, Wynn and Yésou 2007). The recent demographic decline has not yet decreased the species's genetic variability and connectivity found among colonies at least does not exacerbate the species's extinction risk (Genovart et al. 2007).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I. All breeding sites are currently protected as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Natura 2000 network, with the unique exception of the colony of Punta Prima in Formentera where new information has revealed that the prevailing colony (50 pp.) lays right outside the SPA (and the overlapping Important Bird Area, IBA) designated for this species. The management plans for the Balearic SPAs have not been yet implemented. Management plans are therefore limited to colonies covered by other designations, such as the National Park of Cabrera and the Natural Park of Sa Dragonera. Rat eradication campaigns have been conducted at several colonies, including Cabrera archipelago and Dragonera Island, but less effort has been directed at the colonies of greatest concern where carnivores are present (e.g. Formentera and Menorca). At sea, the Spanish Government has started the process of SPA designation based on the inventory of marine IBAs conducted by SEO/BirdLife, which, once concluded, will provide protection to the main hotspots for the species in Spanish waters. So far only a few small coastal sites have been designated as SPAs by the regional governments in Spain. Portugal already has an inventory of marine IBAs, but their designation as SPAs is still pending. Finally, France has also proposed a network of SPAs that include hotspots for the species. Management plans for all the marine SPAs are still pending. Action Plans for the species have been published at local, national or international level in 1991, 1999, 2004, and 2005 (Jones et al. 2008). A LIFE project for the species ran from 1991-2001 (Ruiz and Martí 2004), and Spain and Portugal had a joint LIFE project running from 2004-2008 aimed at identifying marine IBAs, including for this species (Ramírez et al. 2008, Arcos et al. 2009). A number of actions are currently being implemented through Species Guardians SEO/BirdLife and SPEA as part of BirdLife's Preventing Extinctions programme. Moreover, research on the species is also being conducted by BirdLife partners in collaboration with several research centres, with funding from EC projects LIFE+ INDEMARES (Spain) and Interreg FAME (Portugal, Spain, France, UK and Ireland). The main initiatives include the assessment of bycatch through questionnaires to fishermen, observers onboard fishing vessels and conducting beached bird surveys, and the identification of hotspots at sea through boat surveys, coastal counts and tracking studies (breeding and non-breeding grounds).Conservation Actions ProposedControl and eradicate introduced predators (with particular emphasis on carnivores) in breeding colonies identified as at risk. Thoroughly study the problem of bycatch by long-line fishing and develop awareness campaigns directed at the fishing sector, in order to mitigate this threat, plus assess and implement the appropriate mitigation measures. Ensure effective protection for nesting sites and marine hotspots, and the implementation of monitoring schemes and management plans. Develop a rapid response plan for a potential oil spill close to main feeding and breeding areas. Raise awareness and stop human exploitation.

Small freshwater lakes and shallow marshes with abundant emergent vegetation  are preferred to open water (Johnsgard 1978), as are small waterbodies forming part of a larger wetland, lake or river system, especially in the valleys of small forested rivers. Other suitable habitats include small ponds, pools, oxbow lakes, lagoons and slow-flowing streams (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species frequents similar habitats to those in which it breeds (Brown et al. 1982), including marsh and lake habitats and other sheltered waters with high productivity and abundant vegetation (Kear 2005) as well as flooded fields and artificial waters (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species also occurs along the coast (Carboneras et al. 2013) on saline (Snow and Perrins 1998) or brackish lagoons with abundant submergent vegetation (Kear 2005), saltmarshes (Madge and Burn 1988), tidal creeks, intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1978), river deltas , estuarine waters and even sheltered coastal bays).The species breeds from May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a hollow in the ground placed amongst dense vegetation (Carboneras et al. 2013) or under bushes close to water (rarely more than 100 m away) (Kear 2005). Clutch size is usually eight to eleven eggs. In spring and summer the diet of the species consists predominantly of animal matter such as molluscs, worms, insects and crustaceans. During winter the species mainly takes the seeds of aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2013). Northern breeding populations of this species are highly migratory (Madge and Burn 1988) although populations in more temperate regions are sedentary (Carboneras et al. 2013) or locally dispersive (Scott and Rose 1996).","This species is threatened by lowland habitat loss and degradation (e.g. through wetland drainage) (Musil 2006) and by upland habitat loss due to afforestation and other land-use changes (Kear 2005). The species suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (France) (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). It is also intensively hunted in its winter quarters (Carboneras et al. 2013). The species is threatened by disturbance from human recreational activities (Pease et al. 2005), hunting (Bregnballe et al. 2004) and construction work (U.K.) (Burton et al. 2002). The species is susceptible to avian botulism (Rocke 2006) and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), France (Mondain-Monval et al. 2006) and Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006).

A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg/ha, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). Studies in Danish coastal wetlands found that the spatial restriction of shore-based shooting was more successful at maintaining waterfowl population sizes than was the temporal restriction of shooting, and therefore that wildfowl reserves should incorporate shooting-free refuges that include adjacent marshland in order to ensure high waterfowl species diversity (Bregnballe et al. 2004). Since 2000 the use of lead shot has gradually been banned for wildfowling in some European countries (Guillemain and Elmberg 2014).Conservation Actions ProposedHabitat management measures that provide safe and food-rich shallow wetlands are beneficial for this species. Information is lacking on specific conservation measures for this species so future research should focus on experimental trials of management procedures to find out what benefits this species. Also the impact of climate change on the current network of protected areas should be assessed. Landscape-scale habitat management may be necessary for this species. There is also a need to develop an adaptive harvest management system for this species, which regularly evaluates harvest and management measures and compares them to population demographics (Guillemain and Elmberg 2014).",,

Northern populations also use clearings in taiga or in the transition zone from taiga to tundra and forest edge. It is sometimes found on marshland and peat bogs. Sparse and low vegetation is an important habitat characteristic for this species (Yosef et al. 2008). The beginning of egg-laying varies with latitude (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997) but is generally from March to June in Europe. The nest is built by both sexes and is a well-made structure with a loose foundation of twigs, grass, rootlets, string, lined with rootlets, feathers and hair. It is generally placed high above ground in a fork or on a lateral branch of a tree, often pine (Pinus) or poplar (Populus) or sometimes in dense shrub. Clutches in Europe are usually six or seven eggs (Yosef et al. 2008). It feeds principally on small vertebrates such as small rodents, particularly voles, but also small birds, lizards, amphibians and large insects (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997). European populations migrate south to below 60° N but many of those breeding in south-west Europe appear largely sedentary (Yosef et al. 2008).","Habitat for this species has been destroyed and degraded by agricultural intensification. The removal of hedges and trees has reduced the number of available hunting perches and nest sites and reduced food availability. Wide scale use of herbicides and pesticides has also reduced the prey availability. However the cessation of agricultural activity can also have negative impacts, such as the removal of sheep-grazing may lead to the invasion of scrub, resulting in unsuitable habitat for the species. Destruction of peatbogs with scattered pines is thought to explain declines around Moscow. It may also be adversely affected by bad weather and harsh winters. It is also threatened by the development of industry and road building and disturbance from humans, cars and dogs can increase predation by corvids (Tucker and Heath 1994).","Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II.

The nest is a cup of moss, dry grass stalks and leaves, root fibres and hair, lined with hair and sometimes with lichen woven into the outside. It is normally placed in a hole in a tree or wall, among the side shoots of a trunk, sometimes on a branch close to the trunk, or even in a fork in the branches. Nestboxes are also accepted. Clutches are typically five or six eggs. It feeds mainly on insects and other invertebrates (Taylor 2006).","As the species relies on old, diversified forests it is vulnerable to modern forestry practices in Europe, such as shorter rotations and the felling of old trees.

In the western Palearctic the species breeds mainly between May and July. It breeds singly or occasionally in small loose groups in favourable areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species is most common in freshwater marshes with beds of bulrushes (Typha spp.), reeds (Phragmites spp). (Hockey et al. 2005) or other dense aquatic vegetation, preferably also with deciduous bushes and trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) such as willow (Salix spp). or alder (Alnus spp.) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It may also occupy the margins of lakes, pools and reservoirs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), wooded and marshy banks of streams and rivers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), peat bogs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), wooded swamps, wet grasslands, rice-fields (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), rank vegetation around sewage ponds (Hockey et al. 2005), and in places the margins of saline lagoons (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and saltmarshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Its diet varies with region and season but it is essentially insectivorous and takes aquatic adult and larval insects such as crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and beetles (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other food items include spiders, molluscs, crustaceans (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. shrimp and crayfish) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), fish, frogs, tadpoles, small reptiles and birds. The nest is constructed from reeds and twigs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and is normally placed near open pools in thick emergent vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (such as beds of bulrushes Typha spp. or reeds (Phragmites spp.)) (Hockey et al. 2005) close to the surface of the water or up to 60 cm above it (Snow and Perrins 1998). Alternatively nests may be placed in low bushes or trees (e.g. alder or willow) up to two metres above water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Preferred nesting sites are usually 5–15 m out from the shore in water 20–30 cm deep (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Since 1970, European populations have fallen, most likely due to habitat destruction and pollution, however these alone do not explain its decline. In Belgium, the species has suffered from pollution and the drainage of wetlands and in the Netherlands building construction has disturbed nesting habitat. High mortality during migration and in the wintering quarters has been attributed to the European declines. Droughts in Africa have led to desertification and loss of wetland areas, which extends the trans-Saharan crossing (Tucker and Heath 1994). Recreational activities such as fishing and swimming are also a threat as is the intensive commercial use of water areas (e.g. reed cutting, fish farming), river regulation measures and eutrophication (Bauer et al. 2006).

Those breeding at lower latitudes tend to be resident (White et al. 2013). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It inhabits a wide variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates. Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves. Egg-laying occurs from February to March in northern temperate zones and eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (White et al. 2013). Clutches are usually three to four eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19th and early 20th centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). Severe population declines in the 1960s–1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White et al. 2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White et al. 2013).

The birds move quickly from breeding grounds to moulting areas, and after a few weeks quickly migrate to the wintering grounds. The species shows a high degree of site fidelity at staging sites. Birds wintering in the Afrotropics thought to be from Russia, crossing the Sahara on a broad front. European and Atlantic birds move to southern and western Europe. The species seems to have shifted its main moulting grounds from continental (particularly Netherlands) to Britain since late 1950s. Autumn passage is from late July to November, with arrival in Northern Africa mainly late September to early October. Most birds leave Africa for spring migration in March; crossing Europe from March to early May. The males typically arrive on the breeding grounds 10–14 days before the females. The species breeds in open fresh or brackish marshland with rich or tussocky vegetation, grassy or marshy edges of lakes and rivers, wet hay fields, swampy meadows and marshy tundra, in forest tundra and extreme northern taiga zones. The species breeds in general in areas providing combination of grassy cover and moist soils, rich in organic matter. Outside breeding season, generally occupies similar habitats, with more use of man-made habitats, e.g. sewage farms and rice fields, upper reaches of estuaries and coastal meadows. Its diet includes larval insects (10–80%), adult insects, earthworms, small crustaceans, small gastropods and spiders. Plant fibres and seeds are consumed in smaller quantities. It feeds by vertical and rhythmic probing in substrate, often without removing the bill from the soil. It typically forages in small groups. Laying April-June. Monogamous, but both sexes show high degree of promiscuity. Territorial; densities up to 10–38 (even 110) pairs/km2. Nest usually on dry spot, covered by grasses, rushes, sedges or sphagnum. High proportion of the nests may be predated or trampled by cattle (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).","The decline noted in breeding populations of Europe is probably chiefly due to habitat changes, especially drainage.

The breeding season runs from November to June, with peak activity in March and April (Collar and Garcia 2013). It typically lays two to four eggs in a scrape on the ground, usually near some cover (Collar and Garcia 2013). Eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators. Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. Males defend these display areas which are approximately 500–1,000 m apart (Tucker & Heath 1994). The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line.

In the winter it becomes more widespread, for example occurring over ploughed land. Egg-laying begins in mid-April and continues until early July but varies with latitude; in Europe it peaks in May. It nests on the ground, in dense grass or scrub, crops or marshy vegetation. The nest is a pile of small sticks and grass, 30–60 cm wide. Clutch size is usually three to six eggs. It feeds mostly on vertebrates, especially mammals such as voles, mice and ground squirrels. It also takes birds of open habitats like wetlands and grasslands, particularly passerines. Birds are often the principal prey in the breeding season. The species is completely migratory in northern and north-east Europe and is partially migratory and dispersive elsewhere (Orta et al. 2014).","The current main threat is the transformation of habitat owing to intensified agriculture, disappearance of marshes and reafforestation.

It uses open country with many copses, in not over-dense forest, floodplain-forest, parks, orchards and gardens. It is associated mostly with deciduous trees, but locally in pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) woodland, or more open coniferous montane forest with larch (Larix). In Europe it is found in lowlands and hills up to 1,700 m and non-breeders up to 2,000 m. It lays from the end of April to early June and clutches are four to ten eggs. The nest-hole is excavated in dead wood or soft living wood, or in fungus-afflicted hard wood and most often in deciduous trees of variety of species. Its diet is chiefly ants (Myrmica, Lasius), termites (Isoptera) and their brood, which often make up more than 90% of stomach contents but it also feeds on other insects and spiders as well as the nest contents of other birds, fruits, berries, seeds, nuts, acorns and nectar. The species is non-migratory although some local post-breeding movements occur (Winkler and Christie 2015).","The large-scale clearance of old deciduous woodland and conversion to coniferous plantations, resulting in habitat loss and isolation is a major threat. Changes in forestry practice are shortening the rotation period, resulting in the loss of potential nesting trees and a marked reduction in the time-span available for nesting. High levels of nutrient input from agriculture are thought to reduce habitat suitability for ants and thus driving declines in the species main food supply. Orchards are also being lost through the expansion of villages. The extent and quality of riverine forests is also decreasing through flood-prevention schemes, canalization and damming (Tucker and Heath 1994).",Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I.

Forestry management should be reduced in intensity and the clear cutting of older woodland avoided in order to help build and maintain a network of old deciduous woodland. In addition rotation periods in forestry should be extended and the replacement of deciduous forest with coniferous halted. The reduction of nutrient input into areas outside of forest is required and nutrient poor grasslands should be maintained (Tucker and Heath 1994). There is very little research on this species in Europe. Studies on the species's ecology and population dynamics are needed (Pasinelli 2006).

It breeds on open, bare ground or areas with little vegetation (Batten et al. 1990), and has adapted to arable land but only where crops are short or have an open structure during the breeding season, such as maize, carrots, sugar beet and sunflowers (Green 1988); intensively grown cereals are normally too tall and dense in spring to be used (Tucker and Heath 1994). Communal daytime roosts in autumn and winter in Spain occupy traditional sites which have some cover (e.g. shrubland, gravel pits, vineyards) and include both local birds and winter visitors (Barros 1995). It breeds in spring in most of its range (Hume and Kirwan 2013), with egg-laying from early April to June or early July (Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding occurs between February and June in the Canary Islands and from April in U.K.. The nest is a scrape on the ground, lined with a little grass or unlined, but often with a ring of stones or shells and pieces of vegetation around rim. It usually lays two eggs (Hume and Kirwan 2013). Northern and eastern European populations migrate in autumn to southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (Snow and Perrins 1998, Hume and Kirwan 2013). Populations in Iberia are resident whilst the Canary Islands population remain within the island group, but sometimes move from island to island (Hume and Kirwan 2013).","Pressures from habitat loss and disturbance have affected this species, particularly those associated with forestry, agricultural intensification, decline in sheep rearing in places, and human recreational pressure on coasts.

Polychaetes and crustaceans are more important in estuaries however, and molluscs (e.g. mussels, limpets and whelks) are most important on rocky shores. When inland, prey such as earthworms and insect larvae (e.g. caterpillars and cranefly larvae) are also taken.

Removing large numbers of gulls (e.g. Larus argentatus and Larus fuscus) from islands may attract higher breeding numbers of the species but may not improve the overall breeding conditions (Harris and Wanless 1997). There is also evidence that the creation of large marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect this species from the threat of anthropogenic shellfish over-fishing may not be an effective management or conservation technique on a global scale, especially if over-fishing continues to occur in adjacent areas (Verhulst et al. 2004).

Those elsewhere are resident (Orta et al. 2015). Migrants move south between August and November and make the return journey between February and May. Birds tend to occur singly or in pairs, sometimes forming small family groups at roosts. However, they can migrate in groups, and as birds avoid sea crossings (and even freshwater bodies) as far as possible, they form huge concentrations at peninsulas and narrow straits (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is strictly diurnal, and also often follows mountain ranges and ridges (Brown et al. 1982). It inhabits a wide variety of habitats but requires at least some tree cover for nesting and roosting; ideal habitat appears to be forest edge, or mosaics of forest and open areas. It is versatile depending on the prey animals available, with small mammals usually predominating, but in some areas invertebrates making up the majority. The nest is built on a fork or branch of a large tree, usually near to forest edge. It is a bulky platform of sticks and twigs, lined with greenery near trunk 3–25 m above ground, or on cliff ledge.

There are no known current conservation measures for this species.Conservation Actions ProposedIntensive management of favoured habitats, such as old spruce- or fir-dominated forest with abundant dead wood in mountains or damp lowlands of this species should be avoided. Protected areas should cover at least 50 ha, in order to sustain a single pair. Within intensively managed mature forests, dying or dead trees should be left. If there is insufficient dead wood then cutting single mature trees to around 10 m and leaving to decay, may provide suitable nest sites (Tucker and Heath 1994).",,

It breeds on barren offshore islands, occupying cliffs, caves and boulder fields; sometimes inland on rocky slopes, up to 435 m above sea-level (Thibault et al. 1997). Birds return to colonies in February and breeding starts April (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is colonial, nesting in burrows (c. 2 m long) (Fernandez 1995) rock crevices, natural hollows or cracks, sometimes in caves up to c. 20 m deep (Carboneras et al. 2014). Clutch size a single egg (Thibault et al. 1997). It feeds mainly on fish, squid, crustaceans, other zooplankton and offal at least during the breeding season (Brooke 2004). The species is migratory, generally departing the breeding grounds in mid to late October (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is known to winter mainly in the Canary Current (Navarro et al. 2009). Mediterranean birds exit into the Atlantic, where they move rapidly south, but also uncommon to rare off eastern North America (mainly May-October) (Howell 2012), and some birds occasionally range northwards in the north-east Atlantic, to British Isles (Fisher & Flood 2004, 2010) and Sweden (Erterius 2005), with other accidental records from Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland and Ukraine (Thibault et al. 1997). It was previously thought to occur off South Africa in November-May but recent work found that Calonectris borealis is far more abundant over the continental shelf and in offshore areas than C. diomedea (Camphuysen & van der Meer 2001) and the two species appear well-segregated during northern winter (Navarro et al. 2009).","The main threats to this species include the impacts of invasive, non-native mammals and mortality from fisheries bycatch (Derhé 2012, Carboneras et al. 2013). Recent studies have highlighted the pressures imposed by introduced mammal species, and colonies have shown marked increases in breeding success during mammal control measures (e.g. Igual et al. 2006, Pascal et al. 2008). This species is one of the most frequent seabird species to occur in bycatch in the Mediterranean (Valeiras and Caminas 2003, García-Barcelona et al. 2010, Laneri et al. 2010), with estimates of the number of individuals killed annually by Spanish fleets ranging from 200 (García-Barcelona et al. 2010) to 467-1,867 (estimated 4-6% of the local breeding population; Belda and Sanchez 2001). There have been fewer assessments of the impacts of long-line and other national fisheries on this species. Results from a questionnaire suggest an annual bycatch of up to 1,220 individuals of this species by Maltese fleets (8.5-10% of the breeding population), although this is likely to be an over-estimate skewed by high bycatch in a small number of vessels (Dimech et al. unpubl. per Derhé 2012). The species may also suffer significant bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro et al. 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II. In most areas human exploitation has ceased or is only occasional and some breeding islands have been declared reserves. Feasibility of eradicating Rattus rattus from Italian islands with breeding seabirds has been evaluated, but would apparently be of much greater benefit to Puffinus yelkouan than the present species, while an intensive rat-control programme was successfully initiated at two subcolonies on Chafarinas Is (Spain) in 1999-2004 (Carboneras et al. 2014). In addition, censuses, monitoring, creation of protected areas and studies of the species's biology and ecology have all taken place. At colonies mammal control, provision of artificial nest sites and management to reduce disturbance have also been implemented (Anselme& Durand 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedRat control programmes appear to deliver only a small increase in the population growth rate whereas change in adult survival has a much larger impact. Therefore increasing adult survival is of greater importance and rat eradication programmes can only be used to 'buy' time (Igual et al. 2009). Further research and monitoring is required and the continuation of measures to reduce disturbance. Actions to reduce the impact of L. michahellis where appropriate should be implemented. An international network with the aim to prioritize conservation actions and monitoring programmes should be developed. Mortality in longline fishing should be monitored and measures such as setting longlines only at certain times of the day to reduce the accidental catch should be followed (Belda and Sanchez 2001).",,

It returns to colonies at the start of February and breeding starts in April (del Hoyo et al. 2014). The species is colonial, often nesting near other tubenoses (Thibault et al. 1997). It nests in burrows, rock crevices, natural hollows or cracks, with or without some nesting material (Ramos et al. 1997). Clutch size a single egg. There are few if any known differences in diet and foraging behaviour from Calonectris diomedea (del Hoyo et al. 2014), with fish, squid, crustaceans and occasionally zooplankton taken (Monteiro et al. 1996). The species is migratory, regularly recorded mainly from July and October between the Bay of Biscay and south-west Ireland, with sometimes 1,000s reported in single year off British Isles (Fraser & Ryan 1992, White & Kehoe 2014). It winters off the east coasts of North and South America (Olmos et al. 1995, Pacheco and Maciel 1995, Azevedo Júnior et al. 2001, Olmos 2002, Lima et al. 2004), south to Argentine waters (Flood et al. 2013), and in the south-west Indian Ocean, where the species is recorded in large numbers, December–March (mainly November–February off South Africa) (Howell 2012). Off the east coast of North America, the species mainly occurs May to November, with occasional records as early as April and as late as December (del Hoyo et al. 2014).","The species is threatened by the impacts of introduced mammals and shows marked increases in breeding success following mammal control actions (Zino et al. 2008). Other threats on the Azores include the poaching of chicks on one island (500–1,500 chicks taken annually on Santa Maria island (J. Bairos per comm., Fontaine et al. 2011)) and mortality of fledglings caused by artificial lights (Fontaine et al. 2011). The population on Selvagem Grande is not thought to be suffering unsustainable mortality from fisheries bycatch, although it may not be representative of other Atlantic islands occupied by the species (Granadeiro et al. 2006). A study by Ramos et al. (2012) utilising long-term capture-recapture data and year-round tracking data for birds on Selvagem Grande suggests that incidental bycatch by long-line fisheries contributes to a decrease in adult survival probability during the breeding season. The species may also suffer the impacts of bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro et al. 2006).","Conservation Actions UnderwayIn Europe most important breeding areas are in protected areas (Madroño et al 2004, Cabral et al. 2005). In Spain, sporadic counts of breeding populations occur in some colonies, mostly in the Balearic Islands but in the Columbretes, counts are more regular. Reproductive success is also monitored in the Chafarinas (Madroño et al 2004). A study of the incidental mortality of seabirds in waters around the Columbretes Islands (SEO/BirdLife, General Secretariat of Fisheries) found high numbers of this species were killed by longline fisheries, however mortality could be reduced by avoiding setting lines around sunrise and sunset (Belda and Sanchez 2001). Research projects and awareness campaigns, some of which were financed through the LIFE Programme have taken place in Portugal (Cabral et al. 2005).Conservation Actions ProposedAdequate protection (e.g. through SPAs) of all breeding areas both current and historical should be ensured. Actively managing the breeding colonies (eliminating predators, recreating the breeding habitat) and removing predators from the former breeding colonies to promote the natural return of the species, will also help secure the species. The proper use of corrective measures in longline fisheries to avoid accidental capture of birds should be promoted and specific corrective measures to prevent accidental capture of the species in longline fisheries should be developed, in collaboration with the fishing industry. Marine areas which are important for the conservation of the species should be designated SPAs and assessments of the environmental impact of new developments and activities that are planned need to be established. Conduct national censuses of this species and monitor breeding colonies to determine accurate populaton trends. Water sports in the vicinity of breeding colonies should be regulated, especially at night, in order to avoid disturbing the birds. The regulation of artificial lighting in the breeding areas and adjacent coastal areas, to minimize their impact particularly on young birds at the time of fledging, is also important (Madroño et al 2004).",,

Clutch size is a single egg (Fjeldså and Kirwan 2014). Birds return to their breeding grounds in early June and juveniles fledge throughout December (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). It feeds on squid and small fish. Outside of the breeding season birds disperse over subtropical waters in the east of the North Atlantic (Fjeldså and Kirwan 2014).","Historically, the species and its breeding sites have been affected by habitat degradation caused by introduced goats, rabbits and mice (D.

A contingency plan for accidental introductions of invasive species is being developed. A goat eradication programme is on-going and not yet complete. The threat from Yellow-legged Gulls is being monitored (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). Natural vegetation has been replanted, anti-erosion blankets installed, wardening and monitoring conducted and artificial burrows installed on Bugio as part of a LIFE Nature project (Menezes 2007, Menezes et al. 2011).

It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (del Hoyo et al. 2014). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang et al. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh et al. 2012).Outside of Europe, in Syria, the species breeds mainly from March to May (del Hoyo et al. 2014). Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher et al. 1996). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay two to three eggs (del Hoyo et al. 2014). The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae (Tigar and Osborne 2000)), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (del Hoyo et al. 2014, Tourenq et al. 2003).","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas et al. 2009).

Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats. Powerlines in particular may prove to be a major threat in the near future. Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988).","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I.

It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population.Conservation Actions ProposedThe most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species. Create managed protected areas. Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau et al. 2001, O. Combreau and M. Lawrence in litt. 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies. Study the overall demographic and genetic consequences of releasing captive-reared birds.",,

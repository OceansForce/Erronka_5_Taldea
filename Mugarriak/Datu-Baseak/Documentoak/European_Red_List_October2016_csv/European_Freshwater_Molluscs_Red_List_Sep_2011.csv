It is only found within rivers within cave systems, and appears to have been isolated since the Tertiary era. The conservation assessment of Vulnerable (VU A2ac), is based on the estimated loss of individuals in surviving sub-populations combined with total loss of sub-populations from sites that have been well monitored since the discovery of this living fossil. The loss range is between 25 and 35%, based on the estimated generation length of 25 years, providing an assessment period of up to 75 years. In some parts of the range the loss maybe more severe.",Decreasing,"This species is known around seven locations is Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia  Hercegovina. In Slovenia the species is known from one site where it was found as shell deposits. In Croatia there were originally 15 sites described from five sub-populations in the 1960's, but following extensive surveys only three have been re-discovered over the last two years. In Bosnia  Hercegovina it has been described from 13 sites of which four populations have been re-discovered (although not all original sites have been searched). According to Morton et al. (1998) in Bosnia  Hercegovina the species has been recorded from six cave systems at Lusci Palanka, Dabarska Pecina, Tihalijina, Metkovic and Popova Polje as well as from shells in springs at Isvir Krupe and Vrgarac. The main cluster of sites are between Spilt, Mostar and Dubrovnik.","There is little data on population trends. In Bosnia  Hercegovina there is good evidence of serious declines. This species is believed to be long-lived, based on the growth rings in the shell, with an assumption that one growth ring is laid down each year. The estimated age of a species 12.7 mm in length was 25 years, and the largest known shells are over 25 mm (Morton et al. 1998). Morton et al. (1998) also suggests that sometimes there are years with high juvenile mortality and little recruitment.","This species has been recorded from cave systems where it cements onto the rock surfaces. It lives as clusters of shells attached to the cave walls, with the waters having a relatively constant temperature of 9 degrees C and thec# clusters are not exposed to sunlight. These caves are only accessible during the summer periods, when after periods without rain, water levels within the caves drop, allowing access. This drop in water level is thought to be the trigger for reproduction, when the sperm are released into the water, and then in all probability ‘inhaled’ by the females from the water. The eggs are brooded internally and either released as larva with a short planktonic life, or as ‘crawl away’ juveniles, as is the case with Corbicula fluminea.","Main threats to the species come from pollution of groundwaters from domestic sources and agricultural runoff. # Although the species is able to withstand a late summer/early autumn drop in water levels, it would also be vulnerable to longer periods of draw-down (water extraction) as would happen if these cave waters were to be heavily exploited as a source of artesian waters for domestic supplies.","The species is protected in Croatia, however the pollution is still a problem for this species and urgent conservation actions are required to control polluting sources and reduce groundwater use for the extant populations.",This species is not utilized.,"Bilandzija, H."

A small number of records are from the lakes themselves.     Margaritifera requires stable cobble and gravel substrates with very little fine material below pea-sized gravel. Adult mussels are two-thirds buried and juveniles up to 5-10 years old are totally buried within the substrate. The lack of fine material in the river bed substrate allows for free water exchange between the open river and the water within the substrate. The free exchange of water means that oxygen levels within the substrate do not fall below those of the open water. This is essential for juvenile recruitment, as this species requires continuous high oxygen levels.    The clean substrate must be free of inorganic silt, organic peat, and detritus, as these can all block oxygen exchange. Organic particles within the substrate can exacerbate the problem by consuming oxygen during the process of decomposition. The habitat must be free of filamentous algal growth and rooted macrophyte growth. Both block the free exchange of water between the river and the substrate and may also cause night time drops in oxygen at the water-sediment interface.    The open water must be of high quality with very low nutrient concentrations, in order to limit algal and macrophyte growth. Nutrient levels must be close to reference levels for ultra-oligotrophic rivers. Phosphorus must never reach values that could allow for sustained, excessive filamentous algal growth.    The presence of sufficient salmonid fish to carry the larval glochidial stage of the pearl mussel life cycle is essential.    Intact natural catchments prevent fine sediment and nutrient losses to the river. As fine sediment losses become chronic, siltation of the substrate can provide a rooting medium for higher plants. Nutrients can also accumulate in the sediment (and may be chronically or intermittently available in the open water), promoting the growth of algae and macrophytes. This exacerbates the stressful environment for the adult and juvenile mussels, and as more adults are lost, further niches for macrophyte growth become available. There is a resultant trophic cascade in the habitat, where oligotrophic conditions succeed to eutrophic conditions and the suite of invertebrate species changes accordingly.# Thus, the conservation targets for mussel populations include maintenance of free water exchange between the river and the substrate and minimal coverage by algae and weed. The# most important requirement is the maintenance of recruitment i.e. the river bed structure required to breed the next generation. Nutrients in the sediment are problematic as they are used by rooted plants. Dissolved nutrients in the water column tend to lead to algal growth. Both come from chronic and/or periodic loss of dissolved nutrients from the catchment.   #","There are a number of factors leading to the decline and loss of pearl mussel populations (Moorkens 1999, Araujo and Ramos 2001). Margaritifera is highly demanding of very clean river habitats in order to be self-sustaining, but it lives for over 100 years, and thus non-sustainable populations of adult mussels can persist for many years after negative changes in the habitat have occurred. While a range of possible causes of decline can exist (e.g. direct habitat damage, acidification of rivers (particularly in Scandinavia) and depletion of mussels from pearl fishing activities), the overwhelming majority of population declines in Europe have been due to sediment accumulation in the river bed gravels, cutting off the supply of oxygen to juvenile mussels. New generations of mussels cannot be recruited, while older adults that were born before the habitat deterioration remain alive as they are filtering open rather than interstitial water. The source of pressures that lead to this decline come from the catchment into the river, thus protection and rehabilitation of mussel populations is impossible without effective catchment management that is protective to the juvenile mussel habitat. The best populations are known from low-intensively managed isolated catchments with little influence from man. However, some famous historical populations persist in low numbers in large, lowland rivers, where adults may be living in habitats that could not possibly sustain juveniles.    The loss of pearl mussel populations mostly occurs from continuous failure to produce new generations of mussels because of the loss of clean gravel beds, which have become infiltrated by fine sediment and/or over-grown by algae or macrophytes. These block the required levels of oxygen from reaching young mussels. Juvenile mussels spend their first five to ten years buried within the river bed substrate.#         #Other ways in which mussel populations can decline and be lost is through adult mussel kills, or loss of host fish which are essential to the life cycle of Margaritifera. Further details of the life cycle can be found in Moorkens (1999).Fine sediment, once introduced to a pearl mussel river, can continue to cause very serious effects on a long term basis (Ellis 1936, Marking and Bills 1979, Killeen et al. 1998, Araujo and Ramos 2001, Naden et al. 2003). Direct ingestion of silt by adult mussels can lead to rapid death. Turbidity, particularly from fine peat entering the water, causes adult mussels to clam up (they close their shells tightly and do not filter water through their siphons), a response that provides a protection against ingesting damaging fine particles. If the river water remains strongly turbid for a number of days, mussels can die from oxygen starvation, either from remaining clammed, or from ingesting contaminated water while stressed. During a time of year when water temperatures are high, oxygen depletion in the body occurs more rapidly, and mussels die more quickly. The evolutionarily primitive Margaritifera gills and the annual brooding of young in all four of the gills demand a continuous, high supply of oxygen. Even if the adult mussels survive an initial silt episode, food/oxygen deprivation from clamming will have caused them to become stressed, from which they will take a long time to recover. If during that recovery period, there are further incidents of mobilisation of this or other silt, then the stressed mussels will be more susceptible to death than mussels in a cold river in unstressed conditions. Thus, they may continue to die over a period of several months. Higher temperatures throughout the summer further exacerbate this problem.    Once a silt load enters a river that holds a pearl mussel population, it can continue to cause harm. Silt causes river changes, which in turn change the dynamics of the river into the future (Dietrich et al. 1989, Colosimo and Wilcock 2005, Curran and Wilcock 2005). Increases in fine material in the bed and suspended in the water column, and consequent changes in channel form, may affect mussels in many ways and at various stages in their life cycle. The direct kill to adults is only the first stage in the damage that silt causes to the population. Sediment that infiltrates the substrate decreases oxygen supply in the juvenile habitat, which prevents recruitment of the next generation. The sediment subsequently provides a medium for macrophyte growth, a negative indicator in pearl mussel habitats. Macrophytes then smother the juvenile habitat even further, and the macrophytes trap more sediment, exacerbating the problem in the long term. One of the most essential requirements for pearl mussel conservation is the removal of the risk of any sediment reaching the river, as any one single incident has such long term ramifications.      Silt infiltration of river bed gravels can also have a negative effect on the essential species of fish that host the mussel glochidial stage (Levasseur et al. 2006).     As with siltation, nutrient enrichment can have serious and ongoing impacts on both juvenile and adult mussels. Increased inputs of dissolved nutrients to mussel rivers tend to lead to filamentous algal growth, unless combined with siltation, where macrophyte growth can dominate. Filamentous algae can lead to the death of juvenile mussels, through blocking oxygen exchange with the sediment, and cause adults to become stressed, as a result of night time drops in oxygen. Even if filamentous algae are destroyed in a flood, adult mussels may not make a full recovery before the algae re-grows. Adult mussels may eventually die as a result of oxygen/food deprivation.   Death and decomposition of filamentous algae contributes fine particulate organic matter to the river substrate. This further blocks water exchange between the river and the substrate and causes additional oxygen depletion through the process of decomposition. Decomposition also releases dissolved nutrients, promoting further primary productivity. Inputs of organic material, such as slurry, to the river have a similar effect on the mussel substrate as dying/decomposing algae and macrophytes.      Major pressures that are leading to damage of river bed substrate from infiltration of inorganic silt, organic fine peat and decaying organic detritus and from eutrophication are listed below.# These are pressures that are present in many  catchments and their cumulative effects have had very severe impacts on mussels.    Modification of cultivation practices   Agricultural improvement   Explanation: any practice that leads to exposure of bare ground and/or fertiliser applications increase can increase the fine sediment and nutrient load to the river. The cumulative effects of such practices can have very severe impacts on mussels.    Liming of land has a negative effect on Margaritifera populations, through direct toxic effects, and through increased growth rates leading to shortened life expectancy and, thus, loss of reproductive years (Bauer et al. 1991, Skinner et al. 2003). In some countries, acidification problems are so severe that liming is considered to have a more positive than negative effect (Henrikson et al. 1995). However, water chemistry data from declining Irish pearl mussel rivers indicate high peaks of calcium and conductivity levels that are likely to have been caused by liming.    Use of pesticides  Explanation: Toxic pollution can have very serious and long term effects on a pearl mussel river. Of particular concern is agricultural, including forestry, pesticides. Chemical sheep dip is considered to be a very serious ongoing risk to pearl mussel populations, and the most likely cause of a number of major mussel kills (Cosgrove and Young 1998, Moorkens 1999, Skinner et al. 2003, Young 2005). Organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroides used in sheep dipping are highly toxic to species that are a lot less sensitive to nutrient and silt pollution than Margaritifera. The pearl mussel is too endangered to justify specific laboratory toxicity testing, but this should not be used as a reason to be ambiguous about the threat such pesticides present to Margaritifera. Pesticides present the greatest risk when used in a form that requires dissolving in large quantities of water, which is why sheep dip is the most obviously damaging.     Fertilisation  Explanation: any applications of chemical fertiliser or manure can lead to direct run-off of dissolved and particulate nutrients, as well as gradual nutrient release from the soil. The vast majority of Irish pearl mussel populations now exceed the recommended range of nutrient levels for this species. The most seriously damaging nutrient is most probably phosphorus, as it is the limiting nutrient in most Irish pearl mussel rivers.# Phosphorus promotes algal growth.    Overgrazing by sheep, cattle or other animals       Explanation: Overgrazing by sheep in mountainous moor and blanket bog habitats in the upper reaches of pearl mussel catchments has led to loss of vegetation and exposure of peaty soils. This problem has been very serious in some catchments, particularly in parts of the west of Ireland. The bare peaty soil erodes easily and releases fine sediment into the river. Similarly, overgrazing by cattle and other animals along the banks of pearl mussel rivers has lead to, and continues to cause, bank erosion. Furthermore, drinking access for cattle causes direct damage and death to mussels, as well as encouraging further bank erosion and sediment mobilisation.     Restructuring agricultural land holding  Explanation: Removal of hedges, copses and scrub from lands surrounding pearl mussel rivers is linked with possible kills of adult mussels and declines in the quality of juvenile habitat. These land changes lead to exposure of bare ground that causes the release of silt into the river. They are often accompanied by drainage. Drains themselves can continuously erode and be a source of fine sediment. These newly drained areas are more conducive to agricultural practices of greater intensity than before, thus the problem is exacerbated and ongoing.    #General forestry management  Explanation: Forestry planting, drainage, ground preparation, clear-fell, replanting, thinning and all management practices associated with clear fell plantation have been a major source of both silt and nutrients in pearl mussel catchments. The drainage and other preparations of land for planting and the practice of clear felling leads to exposure of bare ground that can erode and release silt into the river. Fertilisation of forestry leads to a release of nutrients into the watercourse, especially on peat and peaty soils. These nutrients, alone or in association with other nutrient sources, raise the trophic level of the river above limits that are tolerable for the mussel. Brash left on site during and following harvesting operations provides further, long-term inputs of damaging nutrients. Ongoing forestry operations do not allow for recovery of the Margaritifera habitat and the future for pearl mussel rivers with continued forestry operations is bleak. Restoration of pearl mussel populations will only be possible if there are significant initiatives to remove clear-fell forestry from Margaritifera catchments. Even given such a commitment, major mitigation works will be necessary during the removal of the forestry and restoration to low-intensity or semi-natural land uses.     Acidification has been well documented as a threat to salmonid populations both internationally (e.g. Maitland et al. 1987, Lacroix 1989, Henrikson et al. 1995) and in Ireland (Allott et al. 1990, Bowman and Bracken 1993, Kelly Quinn et al. 1997). In Ireland, acidification is linked with coniferous plantations in acid-sensitive areas rather than industrial pollution. As salmonid hosts can come from anywhere within the pearl mussel catchment, protection of the entire catchment from acidification is essential.    Acidification has also been noted as a direct threat to Margaritifera from the first international IUCN red data book for invertebrates (Wells et al. 1983). Work carried out in Scandinavia has provided evidence for pearl mussel decline from acidification (Eriksson et al. 1981, 1982, 1983; Okland and Okland 1986, Henriksen et al. 1995, Raddum and Fjellheim 2004). A lowering of pH directly influences pearl mussels through a gradual destruction of their calcareous shell, and also their genital organs (causing infertility), and through problems with regulation of acid-base mantle fluid homeostasis (Vinogradov et al. 1987).    # Stock feeding  Explanation: The introduction of nutrients to Margaritifera catchments through the importation of artificial stock feed, e.g. silage, allows increases in the stock numbers. This in turn can cause trampling damage, soil erosion and nutrient releases.    Leisure fishing   Explanation: If anglers are allowed to enter rivers at pearl mussel beds, serious trampling damage can occur. Systematic physical changes to rivers for the purposes of enhancing fish numbers for angling can also be very damaging to pearl mussel habitat, including bank reinforcement, and the installation of weir and croy structures. Damage occurs during construction, and through changes to flow patterns, leading to scouring of stable gravels and loss of mussels and their habitat in some parts of the river. In other areas ponds are created where silt accumulates with further loss of juvenile and adult habitat.    #Taking / removal of fauna  Explanation: Pearl fishing has been a major problem in the past, and kills from pearl fishing have been observed in recent years in spite of the practice being illegal under EU law.    Margaritifera margaritifera has been exploited for its pearls since Roman times, for leisure and commercial gain, and Ireland's mussels were well known sources of pearls for many years (Cranbrook 1976, Lucey 2005). Pearl fishing has been cited as a threat to pearl mussels across most of its range, and in countries with very low numbers of individuals such as Germany, there are historical records of pearl fishing causing population decline. Recent records of pearl fishing in Ireland are anecdotal, and generally involve Scottish visitors, some of whom come from families that traditionally made a visit to known haunts at periodic intervals. The decline in pearl mussels and the lack of sufficient recruitment has made any pearl fishing unsustainable and the use of tongs to open mussels for pearls has been shown to be damaging (Moorkens and Costello 2004). Thus pearl fishing is outlawed in the EU and any illegal fishing is considered to pose a threat to that population.     Quarries/ Sand and gravel extraction    Explanation: Pearl mussel populations have been damaged in the past and continue to be damaged both directly through removal of gravel from pearl mussel river beds, and indirectly through silt and other pollution from quarrying activities. Severe episodes of silt lead to adult mussel kills, large and small releases of silt destroy juvenile habitat. Another common problem is the release of calcium from limestone quarries, which increases growth rate in adult mussels, thus shortening mussel lives and reducing the long fertile period required for pearl mussel life history strategy.    #Peat extraction  Explanation: Hand and machine cutting of peat, including the drainage channels used in the process, leads to losses of pearl mussel juvenile habitat from infiltration of river bed substrate by fine peat particles released from bare soil.    #Mines  Explanation: Pollution of water courses from open cast and underground mining by mined heavy metals, and chemicals used in the process of extraction of mined products has led to the loss of pearl mussel populations.    #Discharges  Urbanised areas, human habitation  Explanation: Margaritifera is a species of near natural conditions. Continuous urbanisation, discontinuous urbanisation and dispersed habitation have all been associated with depressed water and habitat quality in pearl mussel rivers. Lack of appropriate water treatment (water must reach the river at reference levels), including even small elevation in BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) levels, and even minor increases in ortho-phosphate levels can lead to loss of juvenile habitat. Inappropriately plumbed washing machines can lead to serious nutrient elevations and subsequent filamentous algal growth.    Industrial and commercial areas   Explanation: Pearl mussels have already been lost from intensively industrialised areas, but local and more rural industries such as meat processors and creameries operate adjacent some extant pearl mussel rivers. High BOD levels and other pollutants have led to loss of juvenile habitat and severe depletion of adult mussels.Land reclamation    #Disposal of household waste  #Disposal of industrial waste  #Disposal of inert materials  Explanation: There is evidence of reduced habitat quality for Pearl mussels in rivers where land fill sites are present in the catchment. Decreased habitat quality is also found in rivers where household and other waste is dumped into or adjacent the river instead of being properly disposed of, and in rivers where inert materials such as builder's rubble have been used as infill within the flood plain area to raise and level the ground for more intensive usage.  #  Communications networks  Paths, tracks, cycling tracks  Routes, autoroutes  Explanation: There is evidence of reduced habitat quality for Pearl mussels in rivers where functioning flood plain has been impeded by hard surfaces of roads or paths. It has been reported (Hruska 1999) that juvenile mussels require a direct connection between the groundwater contributing to the interstitial gravels and the unimproved low nutrient vegetation in the flood plain. Building of hard surfaces can release damaging silt into the river. Hard surfaces near a pearl mussel population can also lead to run-off of pollutants into the river. These are permanent effects, i.e. both from construction and operation so road development is considered to present a significant threat to this species.  #  Bridges, viaducts  Explanation: There is evidence of reduced habitat quality for pearl mussels in rivers where bridges have been built, even where they have clear spanned the river. In general, the most negative effects have occurred where structures were not spaced wide enough and, thus, not enough flood plain habitat has been left on either side of the river (see above). The damage is exacerbated where flow changes have occurred, and consequent hard measures such as revetments, walls or rock armouring have been built along the banks in the vicinity of the bridge to prevent bank erosion. Building of bridges can release damaging silt and nutrients into the river. The bridge and nearby road can also lead to run-off of pollutants into the river. These are permanent effects, i.e. both from construction and operation. Other permanent effects include excessive shading under the bridge, and disturbance to adult mussels and reproduction on a long term basis. Where the population of mussels is dense, the mussels form an intrinsic part of the river bed structure, and damage at one area can then cause knock-on long term damage to beds of mussels upstream and downstream of the structure.  #  Energy transport  Explanation: There is evidence of mussel kills where pipe lines have been routed across river beds, from instream works in the river causing silt episodes, and also in silt from bare ground where the pipe has been dug on either side of its entry into the river. to the swathe of habitat removal required before and after it crosses the river.#   Improved access to site  Explanation: There is evidence of increased dumping and pearl fishing at pearl mussel beds that are in close proximity to sites with easy access.  #  Sport and leisure structures  Explanation: There is evidence of increased silt and nutrient releases and depressed pearl mussel habitat where golf courses, sports pitches and camp sites have been developed nearby.  #  Pollution  Explanation: Water pollution, particularly nutrient pollution, leading to increased primary productivity, is associated with agriculture, coniferous clear fell forestry, industrial effluents and insufficient treatment of domestic, municipal or industrial sewage. Very small increases, above natural background nutrient loads can lead to damage. In particular, the normal background ortho-phosphate# reference level# (generally 0.005mg/l P in Ireland) is considered to be essential to the maintenance of oligotrophic waters for reproducing pearl mussel rivers (Moorkens 2006). Small increases in ortho-phosphate can lead to deleterious algal and/or macrophyte growth, so maintaining low levels at all times is considered to be essential. One large input of ortho-phosphate can lead to an algal incident, which in turn leads to detritus/particulate organic matter, causing adult and juvenile deaths and increases the trophic status of the river on a long term basis. Growing algae causes problems by blocking oxygen exchange between the substratum and the water column and through night time depletion of oxygen. Decaying algae causes detritus that not only clogs the interstices, but also causes oxygen depletion because oxygen is used up during its decomposition.    #An increase in trophic status can lead to major habitat changes, particularly a change from Fontinalis-dominated flora/macrophytes to Myriophyllum and Ranunculus-dominated flora where nutrient pollution is accompanied by siltation. These macrophytes are indicative of poor Margaritifera habitat and provide conditions for trapping further silt and continued loss of habitat as a result of changes of flow, sediment and nutrient dynamics (Barko et al. 1991, Wood 1997, Masden et al. 2001, Clarke 2002). Phosphorus that resulted in macrophyte growth continues to be released and mobilised as the macrophytes decompose (Barko and Smart 1980, Rooney et al. 2003).  #  Drainage  Canalisation  Explanation: Both arterial drainage of the river and catchment and field drainage associated with agriculture and forestry impact on pearl mussels. Arterial drainage, canalisation, boulder removal, etc. has destroyed river habitat by replacing natural channel reach patterns of pools and riffles with more uniform runs that suit neither the pearl mussel nor its host fish (Moorkens 1999, 1996; Hastie et al. 2000, Valovirta 2001). Bank reinforcement actions often accompany or are deemed necessary following canalisation. They are a response to external damage to river banks at the site of reinforcement or that has taken place elsewhere but has had ramifications at the site of reinforcement. The reinforcement structures in themselves can affect river dynamics both upstream and downstream of the works (Fischenick, 2003, O'Grady 2006). Hard reinforcement measures are considered to be damaging activities in pearl mussel rivers.    #The increased drainage network has led to an increase in the release of silt into river channels hosting pearl mussels, with the subsequent destruction of juvenile habitat. Drainage of peaty catchments has been shown to increase run-off rates and flood peaks (Müller 2000). Such hydrological changes lead to instability in mussel habitat and increased disturbance.  #  Flooding  Modification of hydrographic functioning  Management of water levels  Explanation: Destruction and damage to habitats in the catchments of pearl mussels, such as through bog drainage and in-filling of floodplains has changed the hydrology of some rivers. A small number of pearl mussel rivers are also regulated above the populations. Flow regulation can have serious negative effects on pearl mussel populations (McAllister et al. 1999, Araujo and Ramos 2001). These manifest mainly in two ways. Firstly, consistent but unnatural flows, particularly more prolonged low flows can cause stress to adult and juvenile mussels by raising temperature, reducing oxygen, concentrating pollutants and providing conditions for silt deposition and algal growth. Secondly, rapid changes in flow regime such as where sluices or dams are opened and closed regularly, is damaging to pearl mussel populations. This may be due to the energy effort of individuals, concentrated on digging into substrate or moving around leading to a state of continuous stress. Where rapid changes are occurring at very sensitive times of the year, loss of# annual glochidial production or newly dropped juvenile mussels can occur. These phases of the life cycle normally occur at periods of low flow, and losses in a natural system through flooding are rare events.  #  #Dumping, depositing of dredged deposits#   Explanation: Dredging has taken place in the past in the large lowland pearl mussel habitats, with large numbers of dead mussels being found afterwards. Kills are likely to have included pearl mussels in the range of the dredging through habitat destruction, and mussels downstream, through siltation.  #  Erosion  Explanation: Erosion of river banks is a serious cause of silt entering the river. Its cause is rarely natural, even when no immediate explanation is obvious, but rather a knock-on effect from river bed or bank changes elsewhere. Where cattle or sheep are allowed to enter the river, serious erosion can occur.   #  Interspecific faunal relations  Genetic pollution   Explanation: Loss of host fish is regularly cited as a potential reason for pearl mussel decline (Araujo and Ramos 2001, Anon 2005). A study on the status of host fish populations and on fish species richness in European pearl mussel populations (Geist et al. 2005) characterised typical fish communities in pearl mussel streams and revealed that a lack of host fish only seems to be limiting pearl mussel reproduction in specific areas. Intact and functional pearl mussel populations were found to occur under extremely oligotrophic conditions with lower host fish density and biomass than in disturbed populations without juvenile recruitment. In Ireland, adequate numbers of host fish occur in at least some rivers with inadequate Margaritifera recruitment, however, where nutrient levels have increased,  more host fish may be required as compensation for lower glochidial production rates in stressed mussels (Geist 2005). A comparison of trout versus salmon dominated rivers of Ireland quickly shows that 100% of pearl mussel rivers are associated with salmon and sea trout. Thus, while brown trout make an effective host fish, the rivers occupied by Margaritifera in Ireland, are of naturally low productivity dominated by salmonids that went to sea to get nutrition. Salmon and Margaritifera have been cited as symbiotic in their relationship, with both species providing a beneficial role for the other (Ziuganov and Nezlin 1988, Ziuganov et al. 1994). Pearl mussels filter the river water and increase its purity, and salmon gills host mussels during their glochidial stage. Pearl mussels have also been shown to prevent early senility in salmon and thus extend their life expectancy (Ziuganov 2005). It is likely that host fish numbers in ultra-oligotrophic situations were never very high, as pearl mussels are naturally adapted to live in rivers with low food levels and very low productivity (Bauer et al. 1991), but an unnatural decline in host fish will inevitably threaten Margaritifera. As well as habitat decline and acidification, impediments to fish movement from artificial barriers can result in losses of mussel populations (Bogan 1993).    Genetic pollution through the introduction of fish stocks not native to the catchment is considered to be a problem, as there appears to be a strong level of adaptation between genetic mussel and fish stocks.    All the pressures referred to above are ongoing and will remain as threats to the population in the future, and in some cases are likely to be exacerbated.  #  In addition, the following are likely threats:  # Climate change    Explanation: Climate change is likely to further threaten the survival of Margaritifera. Increased temperatures will lead to a higher metabolic rate and consequently a shorter life expectancy and thus reduced reproductive episodes per individual. This may exacerbate an already lowered recruitment level. The likely scenario of increased summer droughts and winter storm and flood events may negatively affect the species by increasing the frequency of stressful 'natural' events. These may result in increased siltation incidents during flooding. Habitat space may be reduced as a result of loss of river bed in drought conditions, or instability of gravel beds that are currently stable, through frequent flooding. Climate change may have an as yet unforeseen affect on the salmonid host species or on the food web that they rely upon. Changes in sea level may increase the salinity of a higher percentage of the lower reaches of some mussel rivers, which would have particularly serious ramifications for populations that have now become restricted to the bottom end of rivers. Hastie et al. (2003) predict that a number of Scottish populations may be lost as a result of climate change.  #  Antagonism arising from introduction of species  Explanation: The potential for exotic species spreading into pearl mussel rivers could result in major declines to the native pearl mussel, such as continued spread of exotic Ranunculus (Laughton et al. 2007).  #  #  #","To date, many pearl mussel rivers within the EU have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and the species is protected under national legislation in most countries with various levels of restriction. In most cases, both national legislation and SAC status have resulted in some improvement on direct damage to mussels such as pearl fishing, and some protection against plans or projects that would be likely to damage# populations, but conservation actions are generally lacking through lack of real engagement in how such rivers and their catchments need to be managed in order to rehabilitate and sustain their mussel populations for the future. It is obvious that if damaging activities are not removed and prevented into the future within pearl mussel catchments, that designation of SACs for the species will not have lead to any protection whatsoever.    Part of the problem of protection of the species within SACs is the design of the directive, which restricts SACs to habitats of importance, so that buffer zones that would be of great value in conservation action cannot be part of any designation. There is in theory a requirement to protect SACs from ex-situ damage, but this has not been effectively operated to date.#     A strong negative indicator of the future prospects of this species has been the very poor response of the various competent authorities to dealing with the damaging effects of intensification of agriculture and coniferous forestry in pearl mussel catchments.     Agricultural and forestry operations continue to intensify in parts of pearl mussel catchments, and need to be reduced to levels that are compatible with the life cycle of the pearl mussel. Recent intensification has resulted from both economic drivers and environmental policy. Pressure on dairy farmers to intensify operations and increase herd sizes has led to use of previously marginal land. A policy for compensation of farmers for more compatible practices should be urgently undertaken, as part of a management plan on a catchment by catchment basis. Any compensation payments made to farmers in Margaritifera catchments should be for practices that are compatible with favourable conservation status into the future.  In general, damage leading to unfavourable Margaritifera status has been from cumulative effects of intensification of agriculture over many years. The most important conservation action for any population has to be the production and thorough implementation of a catchment management plan that undertakes measures at source and/or pathway between the land activities and the habitat within the river. Other conservation actions include captive breeding in situations where populations have become severely depleted. This should never take place without a detailed catchment management plan to allow for the return of captive bred mussels to the wild.    #It is hoped that the Water Framework Directive may help develop policies, legislation and management strategies that could work towards managing damaging land uses and improving water and habitat quality. It is imperative that recoverable pearl mussel populations are given the highest priority and that everyone involved in the implementation of this Directive understands the very demanding habitat requirements of the pearl mussel.  #    #  #",Pearl fishing was carried out both casually and by a group of people that regularly took pearls for profit. Some pearl fishing continues today and is a serious threat to the species. Pearl fishing is illegal throughout the EU.,"Moorkens, E."
ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,BIVALVIA,UNIONOIDA,MARGARITIFERIDAE,Margaritifera,auricularia,"Haas (1910) has proposed the genus Pseudunio for this species, in order to distinct it from M. margaritifera. Pseudunio was then synonymised by Ortmann (1911). Pseudunio was used again by Haase (1969) to distinguish M. auricularia and M. auricularia marocana (Pallaray 1918) from the other species of the genus Margaritifera. More recently, the genus Pseudunio was used again by Smith (2001), Falkner et al. (2002) and Nienhuis (2003). We now know (Araujo et al. 2009) that M. margaritifera and M. marocana are different species belonging to a same clade (thus monophyletic), but it is still not clear if we should consider different sub-genus within Margaritifera (Huff et al. 2004).To conclude, we propose not to use the Pseudunio any more, either as a genus or as a sub-genus, as long as no definitive phylogeny recommend it.",Yes,Yes,CR,A2ac,CR,A2ac,"Over the last three generations (using a 30-year generation estimate), the population size of M. auricularia has decreased by more than 90%, as shown by direct observation and by the drastic reduction in its extent of occurrence. Furthermore, most of the subpopulations are not recruiting anymore. It is therefore considered as Critically Endangered A2ac.This mirrors previous assessment of Critically Endangered, under version 2.3, and whilst there has been progress in finding new populations and managing the habitats for previously known populations, the long generation time of this species means that more time is required to confirm any recovery.",Decreasing,"This species was originally known to be widespread in Europe extending in the north to Denmark, east to Italy and to Portugal in the West. Nowadays, it only occurs in France and Spain and is extinct in the rest of Europe (Araujo and Ramos 2001). The current range of this species is recorded from part of the rivers Charente, Vienne and Creuse in France and part of the Ebro river in Spain. Therefore, the species is known from four locations, namely the Charente, Vienne, Creuze and Ebro rivers, with a possible fifth one which has to be confirmed (Dronne river in France). In parts of the range the species has been extinct for hundreds of years (UK), whereas in other regions the decline and disappearance happened in the last century.","Currently in France, reproduction is very scarce in the Ebro and Vienne rivers and therefore these subpopulations are decreasing. In the other rivers, no recruitment is observed at all and most of the subpopulations will have disappeared in the next 20-50 years. The subpopulation from the Oise river (France) was probably extirpated in the last few years.","This species occurs in slow-flowing large rivers. It is dependent on well-oxygenated gravel substrate for juvenile development. It relies on the presence of its fish host (which is believed to be the Common sturgeon Acipenser sturio, nearly extirpated in most western European rivers). Nevertheless, the Mediterranean populations (Ebro river) may reproduce thanks to an other fish host (River Blenny Salaria fluviatillis).","Main threats are/were due to human activities, either by direct killing of individuals or by habitat modification. In particular, dams seriously threat this species, both through habitat modification (siltation) and impeding the migration of the host fish. River regulation, dredging, water pollution and pesticides (there are very large irrigated fields along the banks of the Ebro) and water availability are among the most important reasons for M. auricularia’s decline. Irrational water use in the area is behind all these problems and represents the main threat to the species (Araujo and Ramos 1989).","This species is protected in France and in Spain. It is listed in the Annex 4 of the Habitat Directive and the Annex II of the Bern Convention. Species Action Plans have been elaborated in France (2009) and Spain (2005). It is necessary to take major actions if we want to ensure the survival of this species: surveys in southwest France will allow to discover remaining populations, research on the ecology (water quality requirement, host fish, population genetics), management of the habitat, in particular of the dams and water quality, the restoration of host fish populations, designation of special protected areas and captive breeding programmes.","The species' shell has nacre which was used to manufacture knife hilts, especially in the riverside village of Sástago near the Ebro river, where there were abundant M. auricularia populations. Traces exist indicating that this activity probably began two centuries ago. Álvarez (1998a, b) summarized all the available data on this activity. In the Charente River, M. auricularia's nacre was used to make clothes buttons. With regard to freshwater pearl production, it seems that M. auricularia is not a real pearl mussel, as no reference to pearls is available, at least, none comparable with the pearl production reported in M. margaritifera (Hessling, 1859).Another threat arising directly from people is the possible capture of specimens by poachers, once the risk to the species is known. Collectors may be interested in having specimens of M. auricularia for their value as pretty objects (nacre) and because it is a rare species.","Prie, V."

The mussel is found less commonly in sand, fine gravels and soft mud. U.tumidus lives in a narrower habitat range than U. pictorum being more restricted to larger bodies of good quality, oxygenated water.","The main threats to this species are river (or canal) modification, river and canal management (dredging and weed cutting), destruction or over-dredging of large ponds and lakes, water quality decline, tourism  development pressure (e.g. marinas), competition or direct mortalities due to exotic species. Conditions within the sediments seem to be decisive for the survival of juvenile mussels and thus for the age structure of the populations. Weber (2005) showed negative influences from sporadically occurring low oxygen and high ion concentrations in the water. Aldridge and McIvor (2003) showed premature evacuation of gills under hypoxic stress.

The endemic nature, host specificity, restricted distribution, population status and threatened habitat of U. tumidiformis make this species of the main importance from a conservation point of view. In all its distribution area, the habitual droughts eliminate many specimens, putting the populations in permanent danger of extinction.The water extraction and pollution by the increase of industry and farm development in areas near the rivers where the species lives is a constant threat. A population is known in Spain which had thousands of specimens until 2005, but has been practically extinct after the drought. The population of the Ruidera lakes is endangered by water pollution, urbanism (hotels, recreation areas) and loss of host fish populations. Several sub-populations have disappeared in the last 50 years from the two of the five river basins (Guadiana and Guadalquivir). In the Guadalquivir basin, there is no record of living specimens today, so this sub-population is considered lost. Therefore this species is considered as Vulnerable A2ac based on estimated loss of 30-35% of populations using data from recent loss of parts of 2 out of 5 sub-populations, relatively  restricted range (extent of occurrence under 20,000 km2), and the complete loss of all living specimens in one river basin as well as the decline in the sub-populations of the host-fish which are required for part of the life-cycle.This species has also been assessed at the regional level:EU27 regional assessment: Vulnerable A2ace at the level of the 27 member States of the European Union European regional assessment:# Vulnerable A2aceMediterranean regional assessment:# Vulnerable A2ae",Decreasing,"This species lives in the#river basins of the#south-western Iberian Peninsula.#Live populations are distributed throughout the Guadiana, Mira and Sado river basins in Spain and Portugal.#In Portugal it is known from Mira (Torgal River) and Sado basins.#It occurs in several tributaries of the Guadiana river in Spain (Estena, Milagro, Bullaque, Guadalmez) and Portugal (Amoreiras, Azambuja, Barranco do Vidigao, Caia, Chança, Foupana, Limas, Lucefecit, Marmelar, Odeleite, S.

(2006) provide a full account in their paper, noting that Anisus vorticulus is a Western Palaearctic species with its distribution centred in eastern and central Europe, with sub-populations that are widely separated and localised. Here its European countries of occurrence also include Belarus, Bulgaria and Russia (Terrier et al. 2006). A locality along the Danube in the former Yugoslavia is given by Frank et al. (1990), but it is not possible to locate this site with enough accuracy to determine if it is in present-day Croatia or Serbia. The known distribution extends in Scandinavia to the Skåne province in Sweden (Wells  Chatfield 1992) and in Russia eastward to the Ob drainage system, where it has been found at Omsk and Tomsk (Kantor et al. 2009).According to Inventaire National du Patrimoine Naturel in France it is known from eight widely scattered sites. In Croatia a single record is known from Krka National Park (Beran 2009). In Germany it is common in the northern part and locally distributed in southern part of the country. In the Czech Republic it is only few localities (Elbe, Morava, Dyje) (Beran 2009, in litt)In Switzerland it is considered rarer in the north than the south (Turner et al, 1998). It is also rare in Slovakia with only 10 recent localities (Danube floodplains, lowlands in the eastern part) (Steffek  Vavrova 2006). Only three localities are known from Serbia (Zasavica, Kovalski rit).","There is no comprehensive data about population available. Anisus vorticulus is a hermaphrodite, usually with an annual life cycle. There is localised evidence of decline over much of the western parts of Europe. In Great Britain three sub-populations have shown actual decline of around 40% over the last 40 years with sub-populations lost from around 10 sites between 1950-1990 (Killeen, pers. comm., 2010) and recent surveys of Arun Valley (1999-2010) show a substantial decline of around 60% (Willing, 2010 pers. comm). In the Netherlands there has been a decline of 47% over a number of recorded sites since 1965 (Bruyne et al. 2003).","This species inhabits clear stagnant waters usually with dense vegetation. It lives in various types of water bodies in river floodplains (isolated pools, former channels and meanders), the edges of lakes, banks of streams and slow rivers and drainage ditches in grazing marshes  (Terrier et al. 2006).In Great Britain it occurs in ditches on grazing marshes in clean still water where it is found with other rare species such as Valvata macrostoma, Segmentina nitida and Pisidium pseudosphaerium (Kerney 1999).This species can stand highly fluctuating water levels in floodplain water bodies, but does not seem to survive full desiccation (Terrier et al. 2006).","The causes of the decline observed in some areas are not well understood. It has been attributed to the loss of natural habitat, pollution, eutrophication of water bodies caused by agricultural fertilisers, reduction in ground-water levels and general inappropriate habitat management and modification of the physicochemical character of water bodies (Killeen  Willing 1997, Terrier et al. 2006).","This species is listed in Annex II and IV of the European Union, Habitat  Species Directive and although species is found throughout Europe, in many countries it is in decline, rare and very localised. In Great Britain it was originally listed as Vulnerable (Kerney 1999) based on the limited number of known sites and loss. However, the recent update (2010, in prep.) listed the species on a precautionary basis as Endangered, based on the 60% loss of sub-populations in several of the remaining locations (Seddon, Killeen  Willing, pers. comm., 2010). In the The Netherlands it is listed as Vulnerable based on 47% loss of sites since 1965 (Bruyne et al. 2003). In Germany it is considered as a Category 1 Threatened species, based on the number of sites lost in the southern part of the country where it is now extinct in some of the states (Falkner et al. 2003). In the Czech Republic, Beran (2009, in litt) noted that   it is Critically Endangered. He notes it is nearly extinct in Bohemia (Elbe River Basin) and Silesia (Odra River Basin), more sites in Moravia River Basis are declining, based on the decline of suitable habitats.

Kerney (1999) notes that the taxonomy of the genus Gyraulus is complex and the identity of this particular British form with the species known under the same name in mountain lakes in Scandinavia and the Alps is not firmly established. Confusion arises from the similarity in shell morphology of G. acronicus to G. albus (Müller, 1774) and there is therefore the suggestion that the taxon referred to as G. acronicus in Britain may be no more than a peculiar ecophenotype of G. albus. A further species, Gyraulus stroemi (Westerlund, 1881) has recently been identified within this complex. Its distribution and ecology is very incompletely known, but there are records from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Sibiria.

This species shows a habitat preference for uncultivated land with acidic, sandy of gravely substrate such as heaths, commons and unimproved grasslands (Boycott 1936). Although some populations can occur in more permanent water bodies such as swampy dykes, permanent ponds, freshwater rivers and streams, a large majority of this habitat type has been lost as a result of conversion for agricultural use (Macadam and Baker 2005).","Contributing threats to this species include continuing habitat loss and disruption as a result of improved drainage, land modification and poaching by livestock on agricultural land. Chemical run off as a result of agricultural use of herbicides and pesticides also threatens the species survival (Macadam and Baker 2005).

In the last 5 years, these locations have been visited again by Delicado and the species was not refound at springs in Ibiza nor in Murcia. Thus, no specimens were found in 2008 in the type locality, the river Santa Eulalia in Ibiza. It is suggested that this species may have been displaced by the invasive species Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Smith 1889), since in the sampled section the invasive species was very abundant. The town is very close to the mouth of the river and is also very close to a playground. In the town of Murcia, the Rambla del Puerto de la Cadena, the causes of the disappearance of Pseudamnicola gasulli appear to be the same as in Ibiza, as a large population of P. antipodarum was found. In addition, the low water flow presented by the town and its location close to the city of Murcia and# parallel to the highway, could have caused further deterioration of the habitat. The Red Book of Invertebrates of Andalucia (Barea-Azcón et al. 2008) classifies this species as ""Vulnerable"" as there is a high risk of extinction in the wild in the towns of Almeria. Although it has increased the number of locations in the province in recent years with respect to the redescription of the species in 1988 (Boeters, 1988), these localities are very fragile due mainly to human action. On a recent visit (2005) to the population of San Pedro Creek (Natural Park of Cabo de Gata-Nijar) no live specimens were found in the main spring next to the castle. This spring flagship, the only natural spring that exists in Cabo de Gata, is currently deteriorating by improper use by tourists. Due to the deterioration suffered by the upwelling and its waters, the population of P. gasulli is extinct in this spring, but there are still some individuals in a second upwelling and intermittent piped a few yards down there. Recently, in 2009, another spring was located in the creek farther from the beach and with fewer environmental problems, with a population of P. gasulli. These populations could recover with suitable conservation action. Other recent data (2006) confirms the abundance of individuals in a population near Almeria, the Rambla de Retamar. However, in other locations only shells have been found (Serrata Alboloduy ditch of Turrillas) and the source of the Cuevas de Medina, which had water in 1995, is known to be dry in at least 2006.","Pseudamnicola (Pesudamnicola) gasulli lives in streams and ditches associated with watercourses, provided clean water and oxygen, which have enough vegetation and organic matter for food. Some of these places are close to the coast, in limestone areas and in areas with abundant gypsum. In these areas the water that flows from the springs is quite warm, for example in San Pedro Creek the water comes out at 21°C. Individuals are located mainly stuck to the stones, leaves and branches of the submerged vegetation and even half-buried in silt. They are fragile ecosystems# in very arid areas with scarce water resources, intensive agriculture and human activities including tourism.","In two locations where the species has been lost it may have been displaced by the invasive species Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Smith 1889). The major threats to the other locations are                 human use of the water. Pseudamnicola (Pseudamnicola) gasulli# inhabits extremely fragile ecosystem in Andalusia, where populations occupy sites that are subject to pronounced aridity, where in addition there is a growing demand for water by increasing urban area of intensive agricultural uses (greenhouses) and leisure. The presence of populations in artificial habitats is also a major risk due to the fluctuating nature of them. Casing and cementing the traditional ditches and cleaning of arched fountains and pools is also common. The alteration of water regimes, the discharge of aggregates and contaminants of all types and the loss or degradation of vegetation of the seashore are standard practice in certain sites that can lead to local extinction of this fragile species. There is also a threat from the misuse of the springs near the coast, where tourists and bathers wash dishes and clothes, irreversibly altering the water, the substrate and the flora and fauna of freshwater.","This species is considered as 'Data Deficient' in the Spanish Red List (Verdú and Galante 2009). The Red Book of Invertebrates of Andalucia (Barea-Azcón et al. 2008) classifies this species as ""Vulnerable"". In the 'Catálogo Regional de Especies Amenazadas de Castilla-La Mancha', it was listed in the category, “de interés especial” , a species of special interest.

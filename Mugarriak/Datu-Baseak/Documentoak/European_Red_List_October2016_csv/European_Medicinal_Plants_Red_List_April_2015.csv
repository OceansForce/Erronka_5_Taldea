There has been a decrease in the number of known localities and its distribution is severely fragmented. It is naturally vulnerable due to habitat specialization and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat—a trend which is expected to continue. However, further research is needed to determine the extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and size and trend of the global population in order to evaluate this species against the Red List criteria. It is therefore currently assessed as Data Deficient.It is reported to occur within three Natura 2000 sites; population monitoring and management at these sites is an urgent priority, as is collection and ex situ storage of germplasm from all subpopulations.",Unknown,"A. macrocarpa is native to the central Danube basin (Tutin et al . 1964). According to Euro+Med PlantBase (2006), it is native to Croatia, Former Czechoslovakia, Former Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. It is a Pannonian endemic. In Slovakia, this species is restricted to the Východoslovenská nížina Lowland in the southeast of the country. The number of localities was recorded as c. 20 by Michalková and Marhold (2002); however, only two localities are now known (Balla pers. comm. 2010). In Hungary it occurs in the North Hungarian Mountains (Mátra margins), Great Hungarian Plain (Danube region, Danube-Tisza köze region and Tiszántúl region) and South Transdanubia (Somogy and Szekszárd). It has a fragmented distribution, especially in northeastern parts of the country (Soó 1966, Simon 1992). In Serbia it has a scattered distribution in Vojvodina and in the north of the country. It is extinct from a few localities in the surroundings of Belgrade (former Makiš wetland) and Požarevac. In addition, the species has not been rediscovered since the second half of the last century in Fruška Gora and Deliblatska sands. Additional field investigations are needed as its distribution in Serbia is not well known. In Romania it is only found at one locality in the southwest.","In Slovakia it is very rare, while in Hungary and Romania it is described as rare. In Serbia it is very rare and endangered and has gone extinct from the majority of the known localities; however, there has been no estimation of the population size in the past several decades. The population is probably decreasing but there is insufficient knowledge of the entire population to substantiate this.","In Hungary it grows in reeds ( Scirpo-Phragmitetum austro-orientale ), wet meadows ( Phalaridetum arundinaceae ) and salt meadows ( Agrosti (o) - Alopecuretum pratensis ) and favours alkaline soils, salt tolerant, wet or water covered adherent loam-, clay-, salt soils, rich in nutrients and alkaline minerals (Soó 1966, Simon 1992). In Romania it grows in wet pastures and in seasonally flooded pastures in the wet period. The maximum altitude in Romania is 100 m asl. There is no detailed information on the specific habitat of this species in Serbia except that it grows in wet meadows."," A. macrocarpa is a naturally rare species due to its specialized habitat preference, which makes it more vulnerable to threats. Drainage of wet meadows to grow crops could be playing a major role in the decline of the population. In addition, the transformation of salt marshes into fish ponds across the Pannonian plain could have a negative impact. In Slovakia it is threatened by a decrease in suitable habitat due to abandonment of livestock grazing on pastures leading to secondary succession, while in Romania, wet pastures are naturally flooded by the River Danube which can be polluted, affecting the species' habitat.", The genus Armoracia is listed in Annex I of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture as part of the brassica complex and A. macrocarpa is listed in Annex I of the Convention on the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats (Bern Convention).

PLANTAE,TRACHEOPHYTA,MAGNOLIOPSIDA,ASTERALES,COMPOSITAE,Arnica,montana,,There are two known subspecies: Arnica montana ssp. montana and Arnica montana ssp. atlantica A.Bolòs described in 1948.,YES,NO,LC,,LC,,"Global and European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)Arnica montana is widespread in Europe and is found at hundreds of localities. The populations are stable in some countries and declining in other parts of its range. The reasons for this decline are partly due to collection of the plant for medicinal purposes and partly due to habitat loss. This plant is found mainly in acidic and nutrient poor grasslands and shrublands, a habitat that changes among others due to abandonment of grazing activities or fertilisation to use the land for agriculture. The species is currently classed as Least Concern as it is too abundant to be at risk of extinction in the near future, however the population trends should be monitored.",Decreasing,"Arnica montana is endemic to Europe where it is found from Norway to the Balkans and from Spain to Ukraine. In France, the species is reported from more than 1,000 localities and is found in the Alps, Pyrenees, eastern and Mediterranean area and is only absent in the west and northwest. In Italy, it occurs in the Alps and northern Apennines. It is common in the Czech Republic in mountains and is scattered in all of Slovenia with small local populations. It occurs in most of Denmark's lowlands in the mainland and in the west. In Norway and Sweden there are hundreds of localities. In Switzerland, the species can be found over more than 50% of the country. In Ukraine, it grows in the Carpathian Mountains. Single isolated populations were founds in the 19th and first half of the 20th century in the lowland part of Ukraine (Lvivska and Zytomirska regions) but are now likely to be extinct. In Bulgaria, the only evidence for the species presence is a single herbarium sheet from the Rila mountains without further specifications of the locality. Its presence is therefore considered doubtful.","The populations are stable and big in some countries such as Switzerland and the Ukrainian Carpathian mountains but seem to be slowly or strongly decreasing in other countries. In Slovenia and the Czech Republic, for example, there is a slow decrease due to changes to its natural habitat and collection of the plant. There are strong population declines, e.g. in Lithuania where the size of subpopulations is usually small and the species is sporadically distributed, or in Scandinavia due to shifting agricultural methods. In Luxembourg, it used to be locally quite common in grazed grasslands and heaths and was formerly known from 14 localities whereas now only four populations remain. The current populations show no establishment of seedlings. "," Arnica montana is a perennial plant that flowers from June to July and prefers acid and poor soils. It is mainly found in grassland and shrubland and alpine mountain environments. It also grows in dry pine forests, meadows, grazed moors on siliceous soils, marginal parts of spruce forests, open forest edges, mowing pastures, road and path sides, margins of peatlands. It can be found in coastal heath and benefits from occasional burning of heathlands. The species occurs in the following habitat types of the Habitats Directive (Commission of the European Communities 2009):   4030 European dry heaths 6230 Species-rich Nardus grasslands, on silicious substrates in mountain areas (and submountain areas in Continental Europe) 4060 Alpine and boreal heaths 9430 Subalpine and montane Pinus uncinata forests 7140 Transition mires and quaking bogs  ","The picking of the flowers for medicinal purposes is one of the main threats to this species although it is illegal in some countries (e.g. France). Another threat is coming from agriculture. Here the application of fertilisers to grassland in order to increase the ph, such as limestone dust, decrease the suitability of the habitat for Arnica montana that naturally prefers nutrient-poor soils. The abandonment of grasslands leads to a change in vegetation such as mosses and tall plants that can outcompete Arnica montana . A change of grazing from cattle to sheep impacts the species although it is generally well adapted to grazing as it has flat leaves on the ground. Reforestation also reduces the habitat available to Arnica montana . In some areas skiing is affecting the species as it causes soil compaction. ","Arnica montana is listed on Annex V of the Habitats Directive and on Annex D of the Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein. There are protection measures in place for some European countries and it features in some national red lists:  In Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia it is classed as Vulnerable on the national red lists. Czech Republic: protected by national Law and included in national parks and protected landscape areas. France: protected in several regions (Aquitaine, Centre, Bourgogne) and more than five departements, included in several protected areas.

Lithuania: classed as Vulnerable, protected according to national and regional law. Luxembourg: classed as Critically Endangered on the national red list. Slovenia: classed as Vulnerable on the 2002 red list, protected by law which it prevents from being collected. Several localities are in protected areas such as Natura 2000 sites, national parks, regional parks. Sweden: classed as Near Threatened on the Swedish red list 2010. Switzerland: classed as Least Concern on Swiss Red List (Moser et al. 2002) but regionally found in protected areas. Collections are accepted but there are rules about the amount. Ukraine: included in the 1996 Red Data Book of Ukraine, but not included in the 2009 edition of this book. It is protected in the Carpathian biosphere reserve, in the Tapichirkiskij, Urochychcze Zatinky, Teresjanka, Chorkyj Dil, Stebnyk protected areas, and in the nature monument Verchnje Ozerychere.  Future recommended actions include to manage the mowing of meadows, provide land owners with financial support to graze, and control the change of agricultural practices. In general, in face of the threats the species is facing it should be monitored. In Luxembourg, site management to encourage seedling establishment is needed.

Its collection is now prohibited in Switzerland and Italy, but continues in France on a regulated level. It is widely cultivated within these regions for liquor production (except in southern France where it is still collected), which has relieved collection pressure on wild populations and thereby is preventing further declines. Its status in other countries within its range is more uncertain; there is a lack of information on the population and distribution in the Carpathian and Balkan mountains.Given its broad distribution and the protection measures currently in place across parts of its range (precisely in the regions where collection has been most well-documented), A. umbelliformis is provisionally listed as Least Concern. However, if its population is small and collection pressure is high across its range, and given its increased rarity, it may warrant listing in a higher category of threat.",Stable,"Artemisia umbelliformis is native to montane regions of central and southern Europe, where it is found at elevations over 1,600 metres (Greuter 2006-2009).

In France, the plants are collected in a regulated manner according to the regions. The Hautes-Alpes region aims to reduce or even stop the collecting of wild flowers of Alpine Artemisia species destined for liquor production, thereby creating an urgent need for development in crop production systems. A. umbelliformis is the only Alpine Artemisia species that has been successfully cultivated in some Alpine areas of France and on a larger scale in the western Alps of Italy; this cultivation offers protection of endangered habitats and preservation of natural plant resources within the Alps. For successful culture, specific conditions are required: the plant cannot grow at elevations below 1,600 metres and requires drained soils, south facing exposition and propagation by seed production (Binet et al. 2011). In Italy it is included in the list of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) cited in the Royal Decree n° 772 of 1932 where the quantity allowed to be harvested is 1 kg (aerial parts) (Baričevič et al. 2004).","Studies have been carried out on the essential oil obtained from Alpine Wormwood plants in the Italian Alps. It is considered to be an important alpine plant used to make flavoured beverages and the highly prized Alpine liqueur known as 'Genepi' which is of considerable commercial importance. Due to its rarity and high cost it is cultivated in the Alps in Italy, France and Switzerland for its essential oil (Rubiolo et al . 2009, Bicchi et al. 1984). The highly scented, dried flowering parts were originally used in traditional medicine to prepare herbal infusions against coughs (Binet et al. 2011).

Within the EU 27, this species is present in 15 of the 27 EU countries.Although there are no specific population estimates, it is declining or listed as threatened over half its EU 27 range: it is considered rare and declining in Poland, strongly declining in France, Near Threatened in Germany, Vulnerable in the Czech Republic, Endangered in Austria, and Critically Endangered in Luxembourg and northern Italy. Although it is classified as Least Concern in Switzerland, it is found predominantly in the northern states with fragmented smaller populations in the south and is declining in many areas. It is therefore suspected to have declined by at least 20% across the EU 27 in the past 30-60 years, and is listed Near Threatened approaching criterion A.It is not likely that immigration from populations outside the EU 27 could restore EU 27 populations, as distribution of the species is dispersal limited and especially considering the genetic and geographic separation of the two cytotopes, so the EU 27 category remains unchanged. Across Europe, Aster amellus is assessed as Least Concern as it occupies a wider range of habitats and there are few documented declines across its southeastern and eastern range.More specific information on the current population size, trend and the overall rate of decline is needed, especially from the Balkans and far eastern Europe, to verify whether the species needs to be included in a higher threat category.",Decreasing,"Aster amellus is native to Central and Eastern Europe, Western Asia and Russia (Greuter 2006-2009). Though the species has a mostly continuous range in continental Europe, there is a large gap where A. amellus is missing from the Great Hungarian Plain, where predominating sandy and partly salinized soils that the species does not tolerate are present in several montane regions; further distribution gaps are located in several montane regions where the subtrate consists largely of acidic granite and gneissose rocks (Münzbergová et al. 2011). The species' distribution is dispersal limited both between and within localities (Münzbergová et al. 2011). In Bulgaria it is found throughout the country at elevations up to 1000 metres asl (Assyov and Petrova 2006). It is said to have become naturalised in the UK and Spain, however there are no records on Anthos (2010) or the Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (2012) to confirm its presence there. There is only one record from Norway on the south coast (Artsdatabanken 2010). It has been introduced into Estonia through large scale cultivation. Its presence in Lithuania is uncertain.","The total population size is unknown. Aster amellus occurs in populations of different sizes ranging from few to tens of thousands of individuals (Münzbergová et al. 2011). One study of the European population surveyed 4720 individuals from 229 subpopulations (Castro et al. 2012), while a similar survey in the Czech Republic surveyed 2175 individuals from 87 subpopulations (Mandakova and Munzbergova 2006); neither were comprehensive population counts, instead sampling an equal number of individuals per subpopulation. The number of flowering individuals in a population can vary among years depending on weather conditions, and densisites of the stands depend on environmental conditions, ranging from sparse stands in open forest to densities of up to 7.5 flowering individuals per 1 m² (Münzbergová et al. 2011). This plant is rare in Poland and the Czech Republic (Raabova et al. 2007). It is a widely cultivated and commercialized species in many areas of the world; there are many garden cultivars and hybrids available on the market. The cultivated type generally does not escape to the wild and does not interact with natural populations (Z. Münzbergová pers. comm. 2013, Münzbergová et al. 2011). This species is polyploid (having more than two sets of chromosomes) and exists primarily as two different cytotypes (individuals of a species that have different chromosomal factors) in Europe, diploid and hexaploid, though some minority cytotypes also exist (Mandakova and Munzbergova 2006, Castro et al. 2012). These cannot be distinguished morphologically, but seem to be reproductively isolated and have largely separated gene pools. Although populations of both cytotypes occur in close proximity, most populations present only one cytotype, either diploid or hexaploid. Only one mixed population of diploids and hexaploids has been found (in Austria close to the border with Hungary), but no signs of cytotype hybridization were detected. This is unusual since there seem to be to be no significant ecological differences between diploid and hexaploid cytotypes. The diploid–hexaploid contact zone is large and complex: diploid populations were found throughout central and eastern Europe, while hexaploid populations were only found in central and eastern Europe; indeed, no hexaploid populations were found west of the Czech Republic (Castro et al. 2012). Polyploidy is viewed as an important mechanism of sympatric speciation, and these different cytotypes could possibly be distinguished as separate species. If this is the case, it will have a significant impact on the number of existing populations, population size and distribution of the individual species.","The European Michaelmas Daisy is a short to medium hairy herbaceous perennial found in calcareous grasslands, clearings, slopes, waysides, open forests, scrub and woodland margins, open woodland meadows and rocky montane places ( ""st""> ""st""> ""st""> ""st""> ""st"">Münzbergová et al . 2011).

The plant is however extremely poisonous (Blamey and Grey-Wilson 2003). Its highly corrosive latex is also used for the treatment of corns and as an astringent for removing wrinkles, suntan and freckles. More drastic has been its role as an acrid spring purgative and stimulant, and for treating liver cancer, especially in Russia. The main use of the latex is for an eye ointment - when diluted with milk it can remove cataracts. A combination of the yellow flowers and juice can be used to treat jaundice (Allen and Hatfield 2004). The fresh yellow latex is generally used for treatment of generalised skin disease but this plant has also been listed as being valued widely in traditional medicine for diabetes and for relief of toothache when a decoction of the plant or juice is gargled. Papaveraceae are known to relieve pain as they contain powerful alkaloids with narcotic, analgesic and antibiotic properties and morephine like properties are associated with chelidonine and homochelidonine in Greater Celandine (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003).

It is estimated that 750 kg are harvested from the wild annually in fresh weight in the Castilla y León region in Spain (Herrero and Martin-Lobera 2012). It is highly used in Aragón and all sources of the drug come from wild plants, none from cultivation, although it is easy to cultivate.

The species is considered a complex and further taxonomic study is required. This species has many synonyms, only two of the more common are listed.",NO,NO,VU,A2ac,VU,A2ac,"European regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU)EU 27 regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU)This species has a broad distribution across the European region from western Europe to the Urals in the east, and from southern Scandinavia to central and southern Europe and Krym in Ukraine. The species appears to have undergone declines in Area of Occupancy, Extent of Occurrence and in populations across large parts of its range within Europe, including extirpation from France and Switzerland (despite a reintroduction attempt; M. Jutzi pers. comm. 2014), although numerical information was not found for all countries. In Finland its status changed from Least Concern to Near Threatened category between 2000 and 2010 and 70% of the forests here are thought to be threatened. In Sweden it is assessed as Endangered with criteria A2ac. In Germany it is also reported to have suffered very strong declines, and in the Czech Republic at least 90% of the populations recorded have become extinct and those that are extant are declining (Grulich 2012). It is considered Endangered in at least six countries.Despite this it is suspected that the total population and area of occupancy (AOO) in the European region are not very small. For example, although considered Endangered in the entire Carpathians it is reported from at least 17 localities and more than 200 shoots were recorded at one site in Finland (Salmia 2011), and in Sweden the number of mature individuals is estimated to be 15,000 (Artdatabanken 2010). The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the values required for a threatened category under Criterion B and the AOO is also suspected to exceed these values over its range in both the European region and the EU27 member states region.The suspected long lifespan of this species (Lundell 2014) infers that the generation length is also long and that three generations extends over a considerable number of years; for the purposes of this assessment an assumed minimum generation length of fifty years is used, however, further ecological research is required to confirm this value. Over this time there has been considerable loss of habitat quality and extent throughout the European range of this species. Global Forest Change Landsat analysis illustrates considerable losses of forest cover, within the range of this species between 2000 and 2012 alone (Hansen et al. 2013). There have also been changes in forest management, such as declines in active management practices and moves towards densely-planted plantation forests. It has a known sensitivity to disturbance, shading, and competition and the threats to its habitat quality are ongoing. A similar species has been shown to have seed dispersal distances that are very small, making re-colonisation of fragmented forest areas less likely. There are a range of documented declines within Europe and some degree of threat within the majority of European countries within its range.Extrapolating from the known population declines in some areas and the suspected habitat losses it is inferred there has been an overall population reduction sufficient to meet the values needed for a threatened category under criterion A. This inferred population decline is thought to be in the range of 30 to 60% in the last 75-100 years, a period over which significant large-scale changes in forestry practice and extent have occurred in Europe. However, it is difficult to be certain of precise values. It is possible that population declines are at the upper end of this range but the species does occur within some protected areas, where threats are inferred to be minimized and declines lessened, and in addition data from some countries, especially in Eastern parts of the European region, are lacking and further research into the population status is required. It is assessed on these inferences as Vulnerable (A2ac). Surveys and monitoring are needed to confirm the current range, population and habitat status of the species and to detect and enumerate any further declines, and the species should be reassessed when these data become available.",Decreasing,"The species distribution is circumpolar, extending from Scandinavia, central and eastern Europe eastwards in a narrowing belt to Japan, and throughout much of North America (GRIN 2014). In Europe the species is recorded from France (where it was only found in woods in the Forêt de Fontainebleau and in the Vosges near Bitche (Tela Botanica 2013) and is now considered extinct (UICN France, FCBN and MNHN 2012)), eastwards to the Russian Federation and northwards to the Scandinavian countries. It extends southwards, mainly locally in the mountains, to Slovenia, Ukraine (Krym) and the southern Urals (Tutin et al. 1972). A reduction in range has been noted in several countries including the Scandinavian countries (e.g., Sweden; Ericson and Ingelög 1997), and it is considered extinct in Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002, Info Flora 2014, M. Jutzi pers. comm. 2014).","This species is considered to be Endangered in many countries within its range, for example, Slovakia, Hungary and Ukraine, which infers that it is not a common species here (Feráková et al. 2001, Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2010). The population at one locality in the Machnatý vrch Nature Reserve in Slovakia is, however, noted to be abundant (Adamcik et al. 2006). In Germany it is reported to have suffered very strong declines and has been found growing at only a few sites, but even there tends to be highly at risk (Ahlmer 2010). It is considered Critically Threatened in the Czech Republic with the reason given that at least 90% of the populations recorded have become extinct and those that are extant are declining (Grulich 2012). In Denmark it is Near Threatened. The species is considered extirpated from France (UICN France, FCBN and MNHN 2012) and Switzerland (Moser 1999, Moser et al. 2002, NERI 2007, M. Jutzi pers. comm. 2014). In Sweden the number of mature individuals is estimated to be 15,000 (10,000 to 30,000) but with a rate of decline amounting to 50(30-60)% in the last 80 years (Artdatabanken 2010); the level of decline has been documented to have been much greater in Uppland on the eastern coast of Sweden, estimated (as fraction of localities) by c.80% over the last approximately 100 years (Maad et al. 2009), and this decline is probably an underestimate (O. Eriksson pers. comm. 2014). Based on the examination of local, still existing, populations of the species in Sweden (Lundell 2014) many, perhaps most, populations are 'remnant' populations that are no longer reproducing due to environmental conditions (i.e., dense shade). This means that the estimate of decline based on surveys such as Maad et al. (2009) underestimates the true decline. The population has declined sharply in Norway and is absent from many former areas, and remaining populations are often small (Artsdatabanken 2010).","This woody, evergreen, perennial herb or low shrub is found in coniferous woods often on sandy or clay soils and it is occasionally found in deciduous woods. The species reproduces both by seed and clonally by creeping subterranean rhizomes. Recruitment studies (Johansson and Eriksson 2013), suggesting that the species is 'microsite limited', i.e. there are a lack of suitable sites for it to establish into. Ongoing studies (V. Johansson submitted manuscript) suggest that the species, in contrast to most other species in the tribe Pyroleae, is fully autotrophic as an adult (the others are mixotrophic, i.e. partly utilize fungi as carbon source), suggesting that the species may be unusually sensitive to shade and to competition from other ground-layer plants ( Vaccinium spp., grasses, Picea abies (Salmia 2011)). A study (Johansson et al. 2014 cited in Lundell 2014) of a similar species ( Pyrola chlorantha ) found that 82.5 % of the seeds were dispersed within one meter from the source, and 95.7 % were dispersed within five meters. The seeds are very small and have very little endosperm and culture is very difficult (Moser 1999), and may require bare soil into which it germinates (Ericson et al. 1997). It has been recorded from the Myrtillo-Pinetum, Pyrolo-Pinetum, Pulsatillo-Pinetea sylvestris, Vaccinio-Piceetea and Erico-Pinion phytosociological associations (Moser 1999, Dubravec 1996). It is thought to be a long lived species (Kachel 2006), inferring that the generation length is also long. No studies have been conducted on adult genet life span of the species, and hence the generation length of the species is uncertain, but relating to studies of similar species one may suggest that a reproductive adult may have a lifespan in the magnitude of centuries if environmental conditions are suitable (O. Eriksson pers. comm. 2014). Established genets may persist for a long time even if sexual reproduction has ceased (due to unsuitable environmental conditions (e.g., shade). It is likely that many clonal plants build up 'remnant populations', where established genets persist although there is no recruitment at all of new individuals (Eriksson 1996, 2011, O. Eriksson pers. comm. 2014). For the purpose of this assessment a nominal generation length of 50 years is assigned, however further ecological research is required.","A major problem for this species is not just that 'primary' forest cover has declined greatly in extent, but also that forest management regimes have changed, leading to less favourable site conditions. Most forests (in Sweden and probably also in at least the western parts of the species range) have for long been very much influenced by humans – and there are essentially no 'primary' forests remaining. However, previously (i.e. until the early-mid 20th century) forests were kept semi-open by selective cutting, grazing, and other management practices. These semi-open forests have been common almost since humans invented agriculture and started keeping livestock, and possibly resemble the forest structure influenced by the megafauna during most of the Pleistocene. During the last 50-100 years, forestry management has both changed and declined (with management ceasing in many woodlands and forests), creating even-aged and much more shady forests, and, due to eutrophication, the ground-layer has become more productive. These are the primary changes impacting species such as C. umbellata . For example, the Finnish Environment Institute (2008) consider 70% of forests there to be threatened, with threats noted from forestry activities and clearing for agriculture. Esker forests and heathlands in Finland are reported to be in a deteriorating state, this is probably as a result of changes in forest management practices. This species changed categories from Least Concern to Near Threatened in Finland between 2000 and 2010 (Kalliovirta et al. 2010), and the species is considered Endangered in Norway on the basis of decline in area of occupancy (Kålås et al. 2010). At one former site in Switzerland, dense shading from spruce reforestation is believed to be the cause of extinction (Moser 1999, Moser et al. 2002). It may also be out-competed in some areas, it is noted to be weak competitor against species such as Vaccinium spp. and Picea abies, which are found in similar habitats. In the Carpathian forests, where this species is considered Endangered, threats include intensive logging (especially with clearcut forest management), reforestation with spruce monocultures, development of large ski resorts and tourist centres and motorways (Perzanowski and Jerzy 2001). This species has been found to have a very low resistance to trampling, burning, disturbance and loss of forest cover (Matthews 1994). In parts of middle Europe, widespread pollution by nitrogen emissions from industry have been cited as a cause of decline (M. Scheuerer pers. comm. 2014). The scale of collection from the wild and impacts on wild populations is not known.","The species is protected in several parts of its European range; e.g., Poland, and there are harvest controls in Lithuania (Nature Research Centre 2012). It also occurs in protected areas such as the Biosphere Reserve“Smolensk Lakeland” (Russian Federation) and many Natura 2000 sites (EUNIS 2014). It is assessed as threatened in many countries, for example, as Critically Endangered in the Czech Republic, Endangered in Slovakia (Adamcik et al. 2006, Grulich 2012). It changed categories from Least Concern to Near Threatened in Finland between 2000 and 2010 (Kalliovirta et al. 2010) and it is Near Threatened in Denmark (Salina 2011). It is considered Endangered and is under some protective legislation in Hungary, Germany, Sweden (EN A2ac), Norway (EN B2a(i)b(i,ii,iii,iv,v)), and Ukraine (Király 2007, Kricsfalusy and Budnikov 2007, Salina 2011). The species is not apparently found in Polish Red Lists, however has been assessed as endangered at the regional scale in Pomorze Gdańskie, northern Poland (Nagengast and Rymon Lipińska 2005). Other currently known conservation assessments are: Estonia (LC), Austria (Threatened with extinction), Hungary (EN), Carpathians (EN), France (RE), Slovakia (EN), and the Russian Federation (Yaroslavl region) ('Rare') (IAS PAs Russia 2014).In Switzerland (RE) the species was last recorded in the wild in the 1980s and a reintroduction attempt was unsuccessful (M. Jutzi pers. comm. 2014). The species is noted to be conserved ex situ i n 22 botanic gardens (BCGI 2013) but it is not known whether it is conserved in any seed bank in Europe but there is one accession noted in the National Plant Germplasm System for America (USDA 2014).","This plant contains hydroquinones which have a pronounced disinfectant effect within the urinary tract and it is used treat urinary problems such as cystitis and urethritis.

Associated woody species include: Pinus halepensis, Quercus ilex, Quercus coccifera, Pistacia lentiscus, Rhamnus lycioides, R. oleoides ssp. angustifolia, Maytenus senegalensis ssp. europaea, Calicotome intermedia, Periploca angustifolia, Clematis cirrhosa and Chamaerops humilis. The altitudinal range is from 6-390 m above sea-level. It grows in a range of soils, but tends to be restricted to the Triassic limestone, avoiding the metamorphic, micaceous and graphitous schists. The climate typically has long hot summers (with 150 ‘biologically dry’ days per annum) with temperatures reaching as high as 40°C and mild winters where temperatures rarely fall below 0°C. The annual rainfall is ca 300 mm; most precipitation occurs during September, October and November.MaltaTetraclinis occurs in ‘garrigue’ communities on steep crevices and gorges with a substrate of coralline limestones and calcareous soils. The vegetation of these areas is usually typical of the thermo-Mediterranean region, with plants adapted to considerable dry periods, with chamaephytic shrubs, geophytes or therophytes. Associated native species include: Periploca angustifolia, Ceratonia siliqua, Rhamnus oleoides, Euphorbia melitensis, Chiliadenus bocconei, Opuntia ficus-barbarica, Asparagus aphyllus, Teucrium fruticans, Andropogon distachyus, Brachypodium retusum, Hyparrhenia hirta, Piptatherum caerulescens and Asphodelus aestivus.There is limited information on breeding ecology, with no scientific studies carried out. In general, male cones start appearing in November (sometimes before), shedding pollen sometimes up to March. The female cones produce viable seed in most locations but no detailed studies have been carried out on this.","SpainThe principle threat comes from urbanization, including the establishment of sport facilities such as golf courses. Historically, human-set fires have had the greatest impact on the populations. The most notable fire occurred in September 1992 when 55 ha were burnt affecting a significant proportion of the population (Nicolás et al. 2004). Regeneration after fire can be rapid although it is estimated to take 10-20 years for burnt areas to recover (López-Hernández et al. 1995). A serious fire in the main part of the population (e.g. Cenizas-Peña de Aguila) has the potential of eradicating up to 80% of the population. Post-fire regeneration of competing species such as Pinus halepensis is a problem until the plants of Tetraclinis reach maturity. Mining has been a cause for concern in the past. The extensive heaps of spoil have caused serious fragmentation of the population. In some parts of its range (El Sabinar), regeneration is hampered by grazing for sheep and goats. Competition from invasive species is also of concern; the most detrimental species being Pinus halepensis (Martinez 2008). Tetraclinis is frequently cultivated in southern Spain in gardens and as a plantation species. Some of these plantations are located close to the native population. It is thought that the origin of this germplasm is the North African (Morocco) population. Genetic contamination could be a problem although to date no studies have been carried out to investigate its potential impact.MaltaTetraclinis articulata was once much more common in Malta and the various places called Ghar-ghar, Ghar-ghur etc. point out to the existence of a wider distribution, and possibly small forests (Borg 1927). It apparently disappeared centuries to decades ago, mostly due to habitat alteration and land reclamation (Stevens and Baldacchino 2000). The main threats today include habitat modification and/or destruction (including land reclamation and the clearance of the vegetation) and human-induced disturbance, including the introduction of alien species such as Acacia saligna and Eucalyptus spp. Afforestation and reforestation programmes in its distribution range with indigenous and alien trees, which do not form part of its biotope are also important threats. Competition from invasive species such as exotic Pinus spp. and particularly the native P. halepensis are also seen as threats.","Tetraclinis articulata is included in Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention), and its habitat type is included in Annex I of the EC Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC).SpainThe two sites that comprise 80% of the overall population are mostly protected inside Parque Natural Calblanque (Cenizas-Peña de Aguila and El Sabinar). It also has regional level protection under Spanish Law (Decree 50/2003) which means that it has to have a plan of Conservation. This is currently being developed. The majority of the population occurs within the designated ‘Site of Community Importance’ (SCI) under the EU Habitat Directive 92/43/CEE. The area has been chosen as a priority site under the GENMEDOC project (Herreros, 2004) and as part of this initiative seed collections have been made for seed banking and for germination studies.MaltaIn 1992 Tetraclinis was declared the Maltese National Tree and since then it has become part of the national identity of the country. It has been legally protected since 1993 (Stevens, 1999). Currently it is protected under the Flora, Fauna and Natural Habitats Protection Regulations, 2006 (Legal Notice 311 of 2006 as amended) and the Trees and Woodlands Protection Regulations, 2001 (Legal Notice 12 of 2001). Most locations where the tree is found are protected through either the Environment Protection Act or Development Planning Act. Important localities are also declared as Natura 2000 sites (e.g. Wied il-Miżieb and Il-Maqluba ).","In Spain, the wood was traditionally used for making yokes (for use in mines) and for the construction of houses. Today, due to its rarity it is no longer used. In Malta, there are many historical records for the wood being used for a range of purposes but as a result of its legal protection and rarity it is no longer used.","Thomas, P."

Outside of Europe, it is considered native from Turkey (Güner 1998) to western Iran and northern Iraq (Viney 1994), doubtfully (Kurrto 2009) to north Africa (Tunisia and elsewhere along the north African coast), Egypt (Sinai) and temperate Asia; Israel, Jordan, Palestine (Meikle 1977), Lebanon, Syria, Middle Asia (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan) (USDA 2012).","Although it is widespread in Cyprus the species does not form large colonies, and there is currently no accurate estimate of the population size on the island. The species was not included in the Red Data Book of the Flora of Cyprus (Dimopoulos et al. 2007) since it was considered abundant in there (C. Kadis pers. comm. 2014). The species is found at both high and low altitudes in Cyprus; populations at higher altitudes are stable but those at lower altitudes are declining (O. Özden Fuller pers. comm. 2014). In Malta In Greece, this is a rather rare species with an unusual distribution, for which there is no accurate population size estimation; on the island of Crete, the species is distributed on all its three main mountain ranges (Dimopoulos et al. 2013, Y.

In Cyprus it occurs on rocky slopes and mountainsides as well as field-margins (Meikle 1977). The species also forms the basis of a sub-type (31.8B5p - Crataegus azarolus var. aronia ) of the European Union Habitat Type of habitat type 5330: Thermo-Mediterranean and pre-desert scrub (European Commission 2013). Found at both low, medium and high and low altitudes in Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey (O. Özden Fuller pers. comm. 2014). In Greece, the species occurs on xeric Mediterranean phrygana and grasslands, as well as on open Pinus and Cupressus woodlands and scrub, roadside and edges of wine-yards (Dimopoulos et al. 2013).","Considered to be threatened by the expansion of intensive cultivation and residential and tourism developments at lower altitudes in both Cyprus and probably other parts of its native European distribution. Although the species regenerates after fire, repeated fires may destroy some individuals (C. Kadis pers. comm. 2014).","There is generally very little information on this species. Considered threatened in Malta (Lanfranco 1989). The species was not evaluated (NE) during the preparation of the Red Data Book of the Flora of Cyprus (2007) since it is abundant in Cyprus (C. Kadis pers. comm. 2014). The species occurs within protected areas in parts of its range (e.g., in Malta and in Cyprus). The species was cultivated widely in the Mediterranean for centuries but in Italy this species is becoming very rare and few specimens are still cultivated in orchards and gardens for their fruit which is sold locally (Bignami et al. 2003). An EU conservation programme in 1996 dealt with the exploitation of this species (Bignami et al. 2003).","A fruit tree used as an ornamental, fruit and medicinal plant and is known for its antibiotic properties and high content of flavanoids and procyanidins. It has been cultivated in the Mediterranean and the use of its fruit for medicine has received more attention than other species of Crataegus for its qualitative and agronomic advantages such as good taste, easier fruit harvest and high plant yield under favourable conditions (Bignami et al . 2003). The leaves, fruit and stem of this plant are known to possess moderate antibiotic capacity and are used in Jordan as traditional anti-diabetic agents (Al-Mustafa and Al-Thunibat 2008). It can be used as a heart tonic for high blood pressure taken either as a tea or tincture (Plants for a Future 2012). The fruit can be eaten raw or cooked, commonly used for making pies and preserves (Plants for a Future 2012).

The fruit is also antispasmodic, cardiac, diuretic, sedative, tonic and vasodilator (Plants for a Future 2012). When Crataegus plants are subjected to heat and cold stress this increases the important secondary metabolites and their total antioxidant capacities in leaves. Flavanol and flavanoids are important metabolites used in the preparation of herbal hawthorn remedy for treatment of heart disease (Kirakosyan et al. 2003). The antioxidative flavanoid extracts from the fruit and flowers contain proanthocyanidins which improve blood supply to the heart by dilating coronary vessels, improving metabolic processes in the heart increasing contraction of heart muscles and eliminating some types of arrhythmia and also inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme for treating high blood pressure.

It has naturalised in South Africa, Asia, North and South America and New Zealand (USDA ARS GRIN 2012); it is considered to be an invasive weed in the United States (Centre for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health 2010). Its original distribution is uncertain; it may have originated in the eastern Mediterranean (Boršić et al. 2011), but it dispersed throughout Europe as a weed species associated with cereal crops in ancient times (Wilson 2007, Hensel 2008, Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012, Penet et al. 2012, USDA ARS GRIN 2012). The species has now naturalised across Europe as an archaeophyte species, and is therefore considered native across Europe for the purpose of this assessment.

Previously a common weed in fields and arable lands, anecdotal evidence suggests it is undergoing rapid declines in the UK; these 'natural' declines have likely been obscured, however, by simultaneous introduction of the species into new sites as a result of its widespread use in ornamental and amenity plantings and colonisation from gardens (Wilson 2007). A 2005 audit identified just over 100 sites (only 29% of the total number of sites recorded) that are thought to be 'natural' (Wilson 2007). Although local experts suggest that very few populations in the UK are large or recorded regularly, implementation of arable extensification measures has led to natural expansion of the populations in Britain. As a common garden plant and also a mainstay of ""wildflower"" seed mixes, it can be difficult for experts to tell whether populations are truly wild or have escaped from gardens (Wilson 2007). The subpopulations in France, Germany, Norway, Bulgaria, Italy and Switzerland appear to be common and widespread. The subpopulations in Sweden, although introduced, are declining slowly (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013).","Cyanus segetum is an annual herb which grows wild on arable land with unmixed crops grown by low intensity agriculture methods. It is also found along field margins and is frequent in waste places, on roadsides and on rubbish tips as a casual arising from gardens and wildflower seed mixtures. It is an iconic image of rural meadows, with a pretty, bright blue flowers growing in light sandy soils (European Environment Agency 2010, Wilson 2007, Online Atlas of British and Irish Flora 2012).","In the UK, this species was common until the late-19th and early-20th century, when improvement in methods of seed cleaning and the reduction in the area of land under arable cultivation during a period of agricultural depression led to a notable decline; this was accelerated by the loss of certain crops such as Rye and Flax, in which it was a frequent seed contaminant, and the use of herbicides. Since the 1980s it has increased through wildflower seed (Online Atlas of British and Irish Flora 2012). It may, however, be able to survive for several decades in the seedbank. Modern agricultural practices, such as increased use of fertilisers, the development of highly competitive crop varieties, and the destruction of field-edges and crop rotation, are ongoing threats (Online Atlas of British & Irish Flora 2012). In a study in Bavaria, changes in methods of conventional farming to integrated cultivation systems caused this species (as well as other rare arable weeds) to decline, apparently due to minimum tillage practices applied to prevent soil erosion; however, frequencies and densities remained constant within fields under organic management, suggesting that organic cultivation systems could prevent further declines in arable weed species such as this species (Albrecht and Mattheis 1998).","This charismatic plant is listed as Least Concern in Germany (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012), Estonia (eBiodiversity Estonia 2012), and Slovakia (Institute of Botany SAS 2011); Near Threatened in Switzerland (although it is mostly Endangered or Vulnerable in each region; Moser et al. 2002) and the Netherlands (van der Meijden et al. 2000); and Vulnerable in Luxembourg (Colling 2005).

The flower heads are used in European phytotherapy for the treatment of minor ocular inflammations. Cornflower contains flavanoids, sesquiterpene lactones including cnicin which is slightly antibiotic and antifungal, acetylenes and coumarins. It is used in French herbal medicine as a remedy or anti-inflammatory of the eyes, where the strained infusion is used as eyewash and the petals applied to a poultice, but its efficacy is not proven. The petals can be taken as a bitter tonic and stimulant to improve digestion and possibly liver function as well as improving resistance to infection. The seeds have been used as a mild laxative for children. A decoction of the leaves is used to treat rheumatism (Chevallier1996, Williamson 2003, Garbacki et al. 1999).","Khela, S."

At the moment, the wild populations of this species can be classified as Least Concern in both regional Europe and the EU 27 as they are widespread and there is no evidence of substantial declines. However, extensive cultivation has caused hybridisation of wild and cultivated types; increasing cultivation will likely result in continued declines in the wild population.This species is collected for medicinal purposes and food from the wild, particularly in Italy; collection of only the flower heads may be sustainable, whereas collection of the roots may cause population declines. More information on threats and the number of wild individuals through genetic analysis is required.",Decreasing,"Cynara cardunculus is native to the Mediterranean, including the Iberian Peninsula, central Mediterranean Europe, the Balkan Peninsula and north Africa. It occurs as an alien in Andorra, the United Kingdom, East Aegean Islands and Turkey, is adventive in Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Switzerland, and is in large scale cultivation in central and eastern Europe. It has also naturalised in the Americas and the southern parts of Australia, where it is considered to be a weed, and is widely cultivated in California, South America (mainly Peru and Argentina) and China. It is a regulated invasive weed in the western part of the United States (Greuter 2006-2009, Centre for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health 2010, USDA 2010, Gatto et al . 2013).This species is found throughout Spain but in fewer than 100 recorded localities on the mainland (Anthos 2010). In Portugal and Italy it is found predominantly in the south (Schede di botanica 2013, Jardim Botânico da UTAD 2013). In France it is known from several states, including Corisca (Association Tela Botanica 2000-2012). It is reported from Croatia (Greuter 2006-2009), but its presence there is uncertain (Flora Croatica Database 2004). Wild Cardoon is native to the Mediterranean region from Cyprus and the Black Sea to Atlantic Spain, Portugal and the Canary Islands where three forms have been identified with variation in head morphology: the Sicilian, Tunisian and Catalan types. Western wild Cardoon C. cardunculus L. subspecies flavescens is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula.","Though Cardoon is cultivated widely, the status of the wild population is thought to be declining. The history of domestication of artichoke and leafy cardoon is not yet fully understood, but evidence supports the hypothesis that wild Cardoon is the wild progenitor of both these crops. Selection for large, non-spiny edible flower buds resulted in the artichoke and selection for large, non-spiny, stalked tender leaves resulted in leafy cardoon; the leafy cultivated variety is known as Cynara cardunculus var. altilis. The synonym Cynara scolymus (artichoke or globe artichoke) is a cultivar as a result of domestication of C. cardunculus . Wild and cultivated cardoons and artichokes are very similar genetically, and are fully interfertile, and are thus considered to be a single species C. cardunculus L. (Sonnante et al . 2007). There are many varieties and subspecies as a result of hybridisation through domestication. A study by Gatto et al. (2013) has shown that there were two distinct domestication events and that the western wild Cardoon originated from cultivated cardoon escaped from cultivation. The wild perennial cardoon (var. sylvestris ) is the ancestor of the globe artichoke and leafy or cultivated cardoon (var. atilis ). Wild Cardoon populations in Italy have been found from the Apulia and Basilicata regions, whereas other populations from Calabria, Sicily, Sardinia and Latium in Italy have arised through mixing with cultivars. Populations from Greece and Malta have been mixed with Tunisian populations, suggesting immigration of propagules from outside Europe. Two wild populations of artichoke have been found in Sicily and one in Malta. In Spain and Portugal, wild Cardoon can be easily distinguished and many of the Spanish populations have arisen through naturalisation of the cultivated forms. There may be a continued loss of genetic diversity through crossing with cultivated varieties (Gatto et al. 2013).","Cardoon is a perennial herb which can grow up to 1.5 metres tall. It prefers disturbed areas such as grassland, coastal scrubs and fields and is well adapted to the hot dry climate of the Mediterranean (Fernandez and Curt 2005, Centre for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health 2010, Gatto et al. 2013).",There may be a continued loss of genetic diversity within wild Cardoon populations through crossing with cultivated varieties (Gatto et al. 2013).,"There are no known conservation actions in place. This species has not been assessed on any national red lists. It occurs in eight Natura 2000 sites in Italy, one in Portugal, and a Biogenetic Reserve in Malta (European Environment Agency 2010).","Globe artichoke crop is grown for its large immature inflorescences and leaf stalks which are consumed as vegetables. The roots contain inulin, which enhances the microbial flora of the digestive system (Gatto et al . 2013). The extract isolated from Cynara ""highlight selected"">cardunculus L. has marked beneficial activities (antimutagenic and therapeutic effect enhancing) and its potential biomedical application in the combination therapy of cancer and some neurodegenerative diseases may be suggested. It exhibits considerable antioxidant activity and is of particular interest as a suitable candidate for an effective chemopreventive agent (European Medicines Agency 2011). The aerial parts of the plant are known to have the greatest amounts of tannins, flavanoids and caffeic acid for pharmacological effects (Mucaji et al. 1997). It is a non-food energy crop produced for biomass on land set-aside. Research on Cynara as an energy crop has been carried out in Spain and other European countries with the support of the EU Commission (Fernandez and Curt 2005). It is also used as a fibre crop for pulp and paper production. The plant has been used in regional food dishes (soups and salads) but mostly as an enzymatic source for milk coagulation in cheese making (Gominho et al. 2001).

In horticulture, the species is virtually restricted to botanic gardens and arboreta, mainly in southern Europe, but some specimens are grown or have been grown as far north as Ireland and the south of England. In France, the species was traditionally used in the construction of beds as the aromatic smell was said to deter bedbugs (Gauquelin et al. 1999). In North Africa, tar and oil extracted from the tree was used in veterinary medicine (Gauquelin et al. 1999). More recently, oils extracted from the plant have been investigated (e.g., Barrero et al. 2000, Mansouri et al. 2010), and the species has medicinal uses (Farnsworth et al. 2009).","Farjon, A."

Other traditional uses are fences, gates, feeding racks, and water troughs for animals. Due to its durability, the wood of European Larch has been used extensively for railway sleepers, until these were replaced by concrete and iron structures in modern times. Trees with a curved base were split and hollowed and the two halves joined to make 'Alphorns', large wind instruments with a far carrying low tone; competitions to blow the horn are still held in some regions of the Alps.

Bay Laurel, Laurus nobilis, is a common species throughout the Mediterranean, where it is native to Italy, Slovenia and the Balkan Peninsula. It is likely to be native to Bosnia and Herzegovina but further information is required to confirm this. Its distribution has expanded into western Europe where it has become naturalised in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.The wild population of Laurus nobilis has declined due to overcollection and exploitation for medicinal and culinary uses, and due to habitat loss in parts of its native Mediterranean forest habitat. It is highly valued as a medicinal and aromatic plant, particularly in Croatia, Montenegro and Albania where it is one of the most commonly collected plants. This high collection pressure has caused notable declines in those subpopulations, and it is threatened in Albania and Slovenia; however, it remains common in Italy and abundant in Greece. Although the subpopulation in southern Italy is restricted to forest habitats, the species is widely cultivated there, so there appears to be no significant pressure from collection.Monitoring of the populations and research are needed to determine the species' population status and trends across its native range. As it is not protected or regulated anywhere in the Balkan Peninsula, this species requires legal protection to regulate the large quantities of material collected.",Decreasing,"Bay Laurel ( Laurus nobilis ) is native in the Mediterranean, from southern Europe to Israel and North Africa; it has become naturalised along the Atlantic coast in Europe through cultivation and garden escapes. It is found in western and southern France and is likely to occur across the country in a fragmented distribution (INPN 2012). It is widespread on the Iberian Peninsula, where it has become naturalised through cultivation and where it is thus difficult to distinguish native and introduced populations (Castroviejo et al. 1986, Arroyo-Garcia et al. 2001, Anthos 2010). In the UK, it was first recorded in the wild in 1924 and has become naturalised through cultivation since 1995; it is distributed predominantly in the south (Online Atlas of the British & Irish Flora 2012). In Croatia it is widely distributed along the coast and on the islands, where it also grows naturally and in cultivation (Franjić and Škvorc 2010, I. Borsic pers. comm. 2013). This species has a much broader distribution through cultivation (Conforti et al. 2006); it is widely cultivated and naturalised, which makes identifying native wild populations difficult. The subpopulations in Spain (at least in part) and southern France may be native; however, it has been proposed that the wild populations occurring in the center and eastern Mediterranean basin and populations in the Iberian Peninsula and western France are the result of introduction (Arroyo-Garcia et al. 2001).","The total population size is unknown. Bay Laurel is common in the flora of the Mediterranean and Malta (Baričevič et al. 2004). It also grows wild in Corsica, Sicily, Sardinia, small Tyrrhenian islands and in small coastal areas in central Italy. In Calabria (southernmost Italy), the species is widely cultivated and wild populations are extremely restricted, especially in Mediterranean oak forests along deep gorges of the Tyrrhenian coast (Conforti et al. 2006). Some populations in northern Spain are considered to be natural but genetic analysis shows they are more genetically similar to Laurus azorica , which is native to the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands; the populations on the Atlantic coast and Iberian Peninsula, where it is abundant, are found in habitats similar to those of L. azorica (Arroyo-Garcia et al. 2001).

It is popular as a garden plant for its aromatic leaves, which are also used as a condiment (Castroviejo et al. 1986). It has been used for its astringent, carminative, digestive, diuretic, emetic and stomachic properties. The fatty oil from the fruit, Bay Oil or Oil of Bays (Oleum Lauri), is used externally for the treatment of furuncles, sprains, bruises and rheumatism, and as an insect repellent due to the lauric acid content (Nayak et al. 2006). It is not regarded to have important medicinal uses, but traditionally the aromatic leaves and fruit were used against hysteria and as an emmenagogue, while the powdered fruit in the form of an infusion has diuretic and carminative properties (Conforti et al. 2006). Lauri fructus are the dried, ripe berries of Laurus nobilis . The pulverised form is used orally in veterinary medicine to facilitate removal of the afterbirth in cows and mares. It is also used as a spice. Lauri folii aetheroleum is the volatile oil obtained by steam distillation from bay leaves of Laurus nobilis. It is used for topical administration to the udder or mammary glands of cows, horses, sheep, goats and pigs (food-producing animals), for disinfection and to prevent transmission of udder or mammary gland diseases. The volatile oil and other constituents have antibacterial and fungicidal activity. This plant is also used in perfumery and flavouring in food and liqueurs (European Medicines Agency 1999a, 1999b). In Cyprus it is gathered or grown for its aromatic leaves and oil from its fruit for cosmetics (Baričevič et al. 2004). In Montenegro it is not protected and is free for gathering and trade under Official Gazette SRCG, No.27/02; in 2004 it was one of the most exploited plants (Lipman 2009). In Albania it is among the top ten most important medicinal and aromatic plants, and was among the most frequently collected from the wild with 330 tonnes dried raw leaves harvested in 2001 (Kathe et al . 2003). This is one of the most commonly used plants in the Iberian Peninsula (Uriarte-Pueyo et al . 2011). In Croatia it is collected for its leaves, sprouts and buds. Between 2005-2012 there were 60 requests to collect the species in Croatia, and permission was granted to collect more than 467,000 kg of material, but only outside its native stands; during this period, at least 50,000 kg were actually collected (Borsic et al. 2010, I.

As it is Regionally Extinct in Luxembourg and no stock is cultivated and seed is not held by any institution, a reintroduction from Luxembourg material is not possible but the species could be reintroduced from material of extant Belgian localities (Colling 2005). It may be necessary to develop special areas of conservation in places where this species still occurs but is not protected. Raised bogs are found in every EU Member State, with the exception of Luxembourg. Countries known to hold significant concentrations of active raised bogs include Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland. In northwest Europe, many bogs have been destroyed due to human disturbance and activity. The relatively high proportion of the EU resource remaining in the UK means that this country has a special responsibility for the protection of sites supporting this priority habitat type and consequently a high proportion of the total UK resource has been included in the Special Areas of Conservation series and national parks (JNCC 2012).","The sundew has a long history of herbal use for relaxing respiratory muscles and relieving wheezing and chest complaints, whooping cough, bronchitis and asthma. The leaf juice contains protein digesting enzymes used for treatment of warts and corns and the aerial parts have antibiotic properties used for the treatment of infected skin lesions. The entire fresh plant is harvested when it begins to flower to make a homeopathic remedy. Sundew was frequently used as a medicinal herb. Traditionally it was the source for the drug Droserae Herba but as it has become threatened Drosera rotundifolia is no longer extensively used (Melzig et al . 2001). The plant extracts contain valuable secondary metabolites such as napthoquinones which have antimicrobial, antifungal and antitumor effects. It also contains pumbagin which can inhibit development of insects and parasitic nematodes (Bobak et al. 1995).","Khela, S."

Nikolić and Topić (2005) record the species as possibly extirpated in Croatia.","This is a common species which can form dense thickets within its habitat, over much of its large range and the population is inferred to be large. It may have suffered some local declines through local habitat loss or over collection but in some areas it has increased, for example in the British Isles it is becoming dominant in some dune systems at the expense of other species, probably as a result in the decline of rabbit populations which browsed on young plants (Small et al. 2002). Overall the population is suspected to be stable.","This shrub with spiny branches is found in dunes along seashores, on cliffs, along river beds and at the edge of streams in the arid and rocky places from the sea to the mountains, including in a vegetation type known as pre-Alpine willow and sea-buckthorn brush (APAVHD 2006, EUNIS 2014).","Small et al.

It has been cultivated, for example, in Russia as an ornamental plant since 1850 and is widely cultivated elsewhere. Special farms to cultivate it were created in the 20th Century in parts of Russia and it is also grown as an agricultural plant in Germany, France and Finland. Many cultivated varieties have been developed. It is a valuable food plant containing vitamins, sugars, organic acids, and fatty oils in both pulp and seeds. It is a nectar plant used in the production of honey in Russia (Terekhina 2003-2009). It is very rich in vitamin C (700 mg per 100 g of fruit), higher than the level in many other fruits, and it is used as a fruit juice and made into jam. This high vitamin component provides for pharmaceutical use in the form of vitamin tablets (Small et al. 2002, APAVHD 2006). The species has also been planted in some areas to help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion and also to provide shade and windbreaks. The leaves can be used as green manure and the shrub fixes nitrogen in the soil (FAO 2010, GRIN 2014). Yellow pigments can be produced as a byproduct, extracted from the residue of the berries after the juice has been extracted and this product can be used as a natural food coloring in the organic food industry. Recent studies in China and Canada, have shown that Palmitoleic acid, a rare fatty acid and carotenoid, present in oils from this plant have a healing effect on burns and could alleviate other skin problems such as eczema and dermatitis. A range of skin protection products have been created based on oil from the seeds, for example, sunscreen, skin lotion and soap (APAVHD 2006). Its high antioxidant properties have promoted research into medicinal use for cancer treatment, and anti-inflammatory disorders. A high-quality medicinal oil is made from the fruit and used in the treatment of cardiac disorders (Plants for a Future 2014). The oil is also taken internally for diseases of the stomach and intestine (Small et al. 2002). The species has been promoted for use in erosion control, reclamation of polluted soils, and nitrogen fixing (Orwa et al. 2009).","Chadburn, H."

However, the threat of fungal infection remains a serious issue, and as the disease is spread by wind it is extremely difficult to reduce or prevent its spread tree nurseries have also been infected and the disease is often spread through afforestation with nursery trees, with young plants being more susceptible.",Decreasing,"Globally, Fraxinus angustifolia is native to the Iberian Peninsula and southern Europe eastwards through the Mediterranean, Balkan and Black Sea regions to Russia, and also northwest Africa (RBG Kew 2012; Fraxigen 200 5a, 2005b). It is reported from one locality in Velipoja in Albania, very close to the border with Montenegro (Shuka et al. 2008). It is a post-pioneer fo rest tree with a colonizing behaviour and has a discontinuous spatial distribution across Europe (Gerard et al. 2006).","The number of individuals of Narrow-leafed Ash in the wild is unknown. This species is very similar to Fraxinus excelsior and the two species have hybridised in areas where their range overlaps, such as the Balkans, Italy and southern France, even though they have different flowering phenologies (Gerard et al. 2006, Fraxigen 2005a). In eastern Romania it is very frequent and found in large areas (Fraxigen 2005b). In mainland Greece, eight natural subpopulations with at least 230 individuals have been surveyed (Papi et al. 2011).","Narrow-leafed Ash is a wind pollinated tree found in thermophilous broadleaved deciduous woodland habitats, such as southern European forests, Mediterranean riparian mixed forests, Sicilian Ash woods and floodplain forests; it prefers areas along rivers where flooding may occur. It begins flowering in late December and disperses the seeds late in the fall; no seed dormancy is observed (Fernandez-Manjarres et al. 2006). It is found in pure and mixed stands and grows in well-drained soils in uplands, rich soils at lower elevations, and can withstand temporary flooding; although this reduces regeneration from seed, it can be maintained by coppicing (Fraxigen 2005b). It grows in the Habitats Directive listed habitats 91B0 ""Thermophilous Fraxinus angustifolia woods"" (a priority habitat) and 91F0 "" Riparian mixed forests of Quercus robur , Ulmus laevis and Ulmus minor , Fraxinus excelsior or Fraxinus angustifolia , along the great rivers ( Ulmenion minoris )"".","The most serious threat to this species is Ash dieback disease caused by the pathogenic fungal organism Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus , which causes discoloration of the wood, lesions and necrosis, dieback and tree mortality; severe Ash dieback has affected Fraxinus species since the early 1990s, particularly in the Baltic States, Poland, Scandinavia, Germany and Austria (Bakys et al. 2008, Kirisits et al. 2010, EPPO 2013). Tree epidemics cause secondary impacts to biodiversity, other tree species composition, structure and ecosystem functioning of woodland (Jonsson and Thor 2012). The incidence of infection has been increasing throughout Europe. Ash dieback has been reported from 24 countries to date, though F. excelsior is the most severely affected species; however, F. angustifolia is also susceptible ( EPPO 2013, Forestry Commission 2013, RBG Kew 2013). The disease is most commonly spread via wind; contaminated forest nurseries are another source of the infection, which then spreads through afforestation (Kirisits et al. 2010, Forestry Commission 2013). Browsing of fodder and bark stripping by deer is a minor threat, as it frequently damages young trees in natural regeneration and plantations (Fraxigen 2005b). </sp","Narrow-leafed Ash is listed as Lower Risk-Near Threatened in the Czech Republic, as it is potentially in danger because it is declining in abundance (Grulich 2012). It is considered to be threatened in Albania, where thermophilous Fraxinus angustifolia woods are a priority habitat under Natura 2000 (code 91BO) (Shuka et al. 2008). In Spain, it is listed under regional legislation as a 'Taxon of species interest' in Asturias, the subspecies oxycarpa is a strictly protected plant taxon in Cataluña, and it is listed as Endangered in Murcia (Anthos 2010). In France, it is listed under regional legislation as a protected endangered species in Auvergne [Liste des espèces végétales protégées en région Auvergne: Article 1], where all destruction, collection, and trade of wild specimens is prohibited (Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle 2003-2013). This species is included in the EC Council Directive 1999/105/EC on the marketing of Forest Reproductive Material subject to regulation (Fraxigen 2005a) and the Council Directive 92/43/EEC for conservation of natural habitats (Council of Europe 1992).

Research into and monitoring of its population size and trends is required to track the spread and impact of ash dieback disease. As Ash dieback disease is spread by wind, it is extremely difficult to reduce or prevent spread of the disease, which can even reach isolated trees found more than 10 km from the nearest tree; the best hope for control of the outbreak is that natural resistance will develop (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013). <span c","Narrow-leafed Ash has ecological and economic importance for afforestation, for example along the river March in eastern Austria (Kirisits et al. 2010). Ash species are one of the main species in hardwood plantations in Europe for their valuable wood and fast growing characteristics. F. angustifolia is increasingly being used for plantations. It is a suitable tree for lowland and submontane areas and is a fast growing species which provides good quality wood, which tends to be higher in dryer parts of southern Europe (Cicek and Yilmaz 2005). The leaves, both fresh and dried, are palatable and nutritious to animals and were used as fodder in southern Europe. It is widely used throughout Europe as an ornamental tree and for urban landscaping (Fraxigen 2005b). It used to be valued as traditional herbal medicine. Fraxini folium, or ash leaf, is by definition the dried leaf of Fraxinus excelsior or F. angustifolia , of hybrids of these two species, or of a mixture of both, where the comminuted herbal substance is used as herbal tea or powdered leaves in capsule.

It occurs in ;all European countries except Portugal. It is a hardwood species and is important for silviculture, and is an economically valuable source of timber from tree nurseries and plantations.Ash dieback is an infectious disease that has caused severe dieback of Common Ash throughout Europe. This is the most serious threat to the species, with recorded incidence in 24 countries and a high risk of spread to areas where it has not yet been observed. This species is considered to be seriously threatened in Hungary where there is a high incidence of infection, and is threatened or Near Threatened in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Albania, Serbia and Montenegro, as well as in regions of Spain. As Ash dieback disease is spread by wind, it is extremely difficult to reduce or prevent spread of the disease and the entire population is at risk of further disease outbreaks. The overall population decline has not been quantified and little data is available to precisely estimate future decline rates, but given the dramatic declines seen in some parts of the species range, a future decline of at least 20-30% across Europe is possible. This species is therefore precautionarily listed as Near Threatened approaching criterion A3e on both the European and EU 27 levels. Potential immigrants from outside Europe will be susceptible to the disease and will not be able to rescue the European population; the category therefore remains unchanged.More information is needed on how much the population has declined from fungal infection, through mortality or felling for preventative measures, and there is a need for population monitoring, including for signs of disease. Management of infected stands for preventative spread of the disease should be attempted, though the best hope for control of the outbreak is that natural resistance will develop. Populations should be monitored for signs of resistance to the disease, in the hopes that resistant stands may be found. It is strongly recommended to collect detailed population information and decline rates from each country and to re-assess the species when all the data is available. It might then warrant listing in a more threatened category.",Decreasing,"Fraxinus excelsior has a large native range and is the most widely distributed ash species in Europe. It is found in all countries in Europe, except Portugal, and ranges eastward to Russia and Iran. It is found in the Alps and Pyrenees at elevations up to 1600-1800 metres, but only up to 450 metres in more northern latitudes (e.g. in the United Kingdom). This species has a continuous distribution except for the two subpopulations in Norway and Gotland (a Swedish island in the Baltic Sea), which are fragmented and isolated and also at the edge of the species' northern range (Fraxigen 2005).","The Common Ash's total population size in Europe is unknown. It remains widespread and common, but the population is declining as a result of Ash dieback disease. In Sweden, the population has declined by 10-30% in the past 100 years, and is expected to decline by up to 30% (best estimate within a range of 20-80%) over the next 100 years; the possibility exists that the Swedish population may be eliminated very rapidly as a result of the disease (ArtDatabanken 2010). In Norway, where there it reason to believe this effects of the disease will be severe, the population is expected to decline by 10-30% over the next century (Artsdatabanken 2010). Population declines are expected to be as severe in at least some other parts of the species' range as well. This species is widely planted and therefore it can be difficult to determine which populations are native and which are alien (Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012). It is very similar to Fraxinus angustifolia and the two species have hybridised in areas where their range overlaps, such as the Balkans, Italy and southern France, even though they have different flowering phenologies (Fraxigen 2005, Gerard et al. 2006).

It is tolerant of waterlogged but not flooded soils and only grows in lime rich soils. It occurs in pure stands, mixed woodland or scattered trees and is a dominant species in young and juvenile stages of forests. Its natural distribution in central Europe is defined by its low tolerance to cold winters and hot dry summers as young shoots are sensitive to spring frost.

Tree epidemics cause secondary impacts to biodiversity, other tree species composition, structure and ecosystem functioning of woodland (Jonsson and Thor 2012). The incidence of infection has been increasing throughout Europe. The disease causes dieback of the crown and loss of leaves and can lead to death of the tree. A wide range of Fraxinus species have reportedly been infected with this disease, although F. excelsior is the most severely affected species (RBG Kew 2013). Ash dieback has been reported from 24 countries to date (EPPO 2013). In Lithuania and Poland, where the disease was first discovered , between 60 and 80 % of the Ash population was lost within a decade (ArtDatabanken 2010). The disease was recorded in Finland in 2007 and seems to be spreading (T. Ryttäri pers. comm. 2013). It was recorded in seven localities in Hungary in 2008, though it can take 2-3 years for the symptoms to become apparent so it may be more widespread (Koltay et al. 2012).

Sub-populations are isolated and the regeneration of the population is limited due to land use changes, particularly abandonment of pastures; populations in secondary habitats show reduced genetic variability, which may affect the ability of the species to adapt to changing conditions in future. Changes in land use have also resulted in declines in the quality and quantity of available habitat. It has been threatened by exhaustive over-collection for its use in the past; it remains unclear if its collection still continues or if it exists in cultivation. The species is threatened in four out of six countries in which it occurs (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland). It is very rare in Italy, where it is known from only one locality; subpopulations in Slovenia are not declining. The population is declining in parts of its range, but stable in others, and it is not known whether overall decline rates approach or exceed 30%. Given its restricted and scattered distribution, the area of occupancy (AOO) may be less than 2,000 km²; it occurs in more than 10 locations but may be considered severely fragmented, as subpopulations are scattered and isolated and seedling establishment limited.The overall population decline has not been quantified and as the plant has a clonal structure, it is difficult to determine the generation length. It is also difficult to estimate the number of mature individuals, as this species can remain inconspicuous for relatively long periods of time. Based on population surveys across much of its range in the eastern Alps, the population size may be quite low (perhaps as low as 10,000-15,000 mature individuals), but this cannot be confirmed with the information available. This species is listed as Near Threatened, nearly meeting B2ab(iii,v), in both Europe and the EU 27. More precise estimates of its distribution are required to measure AOO with more certainty. It is also strongly recommended to collect detailed population information and decline rates from each country and to re-assess the species when all the data is available. It may then require a higher threat category.",Decreasing,"Hungarian Gentian, Gentiana pannonica, is restricted to central Europe (Hofhanzlová and Křenová 2007, Marhold 2011, Ekrtová and Košnar 2012, Ekrtova et al. 2012). The centre of its distribution is in the Eastern Alps in Austria, Germany and Slovenia; it also occurs sporadically in the southern and central Alps (Italy and Switzerland) at elevations over 1,000 metres. In Germany it is found in two small, distinct areas: on the southern border with Austria in the Alps, and a smaller area on the eastern border with the Czech Republic (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012). In Italy it is known from one locality, and in Slovenia it is found in several localities. Outside the Alps, it is scattered in the Bohemian Forest in the border region of the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria (though most localities are situated in the Czech part of the mountains), and is rare in the Giant Mountains and the Jesenıky Mountains (Hofhanzlová and Křenová 2007, Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). The latter two occurrences are sometimes considered to be remnants of former cultivations and thus introduced, but it may indeed be native to the Giant Mountains (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012).","In the primary habitats in the Eastern Alps and the Bohemian Forest, Hungarian Gentian occurs in isolated mountain ranges in small and often distant clusters, with few plants scattered over wide areas. It is only found in numerous subpopulations in the secondary habitats of the Bohemian Forest. The populations in the Giant Mountains are very small (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). The populations of G. pannonica in the Bohemian Forest are isolated from each other and seedlings are rare, though vegetative propagation continues (Hofhanzlová and Křenová 2007). Subpopulations have been considered threatened but stable in central Europe, where declines are balanced out by increases (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012). A survey carried out during 2000-2001 in the Czech Republic, at a study site in the centre of the species’ distribution in the Bohemian Forest , found the subpopulation size to be about 400 leaf rosettes (clumps) over 9 ha, with about 300 ﬂowering stems (Hofhanzlová and Křenová 2007). In Italy it is very rare (Lipman 2009). In Switzerland, there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals and the subpopulation is declining (Moser et al. 2002). It occurs in no more than 20 localities in the Czech Republic and a few subpopulations have become extinct, though the extant subpopulations are not clearly declining (Grulich 2012). The total number of individuals sampled from twenty subpopulations in fifteen localities in Austria and the Czech Republic was more than 3,265 leaf rosettes and polycormons (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). In Austria, the main subpopulation in the Alps is not declining, though there are small declining subpopulations in the north-east border with the Czech Republic; it is not reportedly declining in Slovenia (K.-G. Bernhardt pers. comm. 2013). ","Hungarian Gentian is a long-lived hemicryptophyte (a plant with perennial buds situated at or just below the soil surface) that spreads mainly by clonal growth; it is self-compatible, though mainly out-crosses, and is pollinated by bumble bees. It is a sub-Alpine species that colonizes both the primary (relict) and the secondary (semi-natural) habitats near the timberline (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). It is typical of the east-Alpine flora, found in primary habitats in Alpine and sub-Alpine areas growing on calcareous and silicone bedrock in tall-forb vegetation and grasslands, mixed with scrubs of Pinus mugo or Alnus alnobetula ; it is very rare in secondary treeless habitats in the Alps (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). In the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic, the species occupies tall-grass and tall-forb vegetation in the cirques of glacial lakes, stream banks and secondary montane meadows (Hofhanzlová and Fér 2009); regeneration is lower here than in primary habitats due to unfavourable conditions caused by long term lack of grazing disturbances (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). Successful seedling recruitment is limited by several factors. Ekrtová and Košnar (2012) found that seedling recruitment was only successful in primary habitats and stream banks in secondary habitats. A high abundance of the herb layer in the secondary montane meadows may be an important factor that prevents successful seedling emergence; in addition, intensity of competition limits establishment and survival of seedlings, while sufficient soil moisture is required for seedling recruitment.","Land use changes, particularly abandonment of pastures, meadows and heaths, prevents seedling establishment and has reduced the regeneration of the population (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). Low-intensity grazing is important as it repeatedly disturbs the vegetation cover, creates spots of open bare soil, reduces strong competitors in grasslands, and prevents forest establishment. This species has been exhaustively collected on a large scale by professional root diggers for its use, particularly during the 19th century, with collection of up to 200 kg of roots per collector daily (Aubert et al. 2007). Intrapopulation genetic variation is lower in secondary habitats (where recent conditions seem to be unsuitable for spontaneous seedling recruitment) than in primary habitats, though there is still considerable clone diversity in these sites; this decreased genetic diversity may have resulted from historical processes, such as isolation and population density reduction, followed by bottlenecks during the Holocene (Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). Even if declines in genetic diversity occurred historically, these can limit the species' ability to adapt to changing conditions into the future.","This plant is classified as Endangered in the Czech Republic due to rarity and loss of subpopulations (Holub and Procházka 2000, Grulich 2012). It is also listed as Endangered in Switzerland (EN C2a; Moser et al. 2002), and is threatened (3: gefährdet) in Germany (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012). It is listed as endangered on the Austrian Red List, due to declines in the small populations near the border with the Czech Republic (K.-G. Bernhardt pers. comm. 2013). It is protected in Germany under the Federal Nature Conservation Act (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012). It is only protected in one Natura 2000 site in Austria (European Environment Agency 2010). Seed is stored in the Germplasm Bank of the Department of Land Ecology of the University of Pavia in Italy (Lipman 2009). The conservation of Hungarian Gentian in its secondary habitats requires the management of succession; restoration of the traditional land use is necessary, particularly for maintaining this species in its secondary habitats ( Ekrtová and Košnar 2012). ","A medicinal and aromatic plant, like many other species of Gentiana , this species is rich in bitter-tasting secoiridoid glucosides, which are applied in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract diseases. The roots are applied as a decoction, extract or tincture (Lipman 2009, Skrzypczak et al. 1993).

In Bulgaria the extent of occurrence (EOO) is reported to be less than 1,000 km2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) less than 10 km2. Sub-populations are said to be small at several sites, but sub-populations in the area of Varnensko Lake and south of Zelenka Cape are more numerous (more than 500 individuals). From this it is inferred that the population even in the EU27 exceeds the value needed for a threatened category under criterion D. It is considered Endangered in Bulgaria under criterion B, with a continuing decline in AOO, area, extent and quality of habitat and number of locations or sub-populations cited. It is considered to be vulnerable in Romania. When records for both countries are mapped the estimated EOO is 37,000 km2 which exceeds the values needed for a threatened category. However, it is suspected that the AOO is less than 2,000 km2. The number of locations exceeds ten and, as a perennial herb, it is not thought to be subject to extreme fluctuations.Sub-populations occur mainly in a narrow coastal area along the Black Sea, but they are suspected not to be severely fragmented, particularly as this species is noted to be able to colonize railway lines which may provide connectivity between areas.This species is also recorded from several protected areas where, if correctly managed, threats should be minimized. However populations may still decline as this could be considered an edge of range satellite population ;and subject to demographic stochasticity (Hanski 1982). On this basis it is assessed as Near Threatened within the EU27 as it is suspected to satisfy the criterion B2 but only one of the sub-criteria (b). In Europe (outside the EU27) it is noted to occur in communities around the Sea of Azov, the lower Don, lower Volga and Trans-Volga areas. This further increases the EOO and population numbers, and possibly connectivity to further populations to the east. However, it is inferred to be subject to similar declines and may have a similarly small AOO. It is suspected that the total AOO may not exceed, or may be close to, 2,000 km2. It is assessed as Near Threatened. However, further surveys are needed to confirm the current AOO and monitoring is necessary to detect and enumerate declines.",Unknown,"The species is native to the European part of the Black Sea and extends eastwards into temperate Asia as far east as China and Siberia (USDA 2012, Marhold 2011).

It is recorded as native in Bulgaria and Romania in the Black Sea coastal areas. It has been unintentionally introduced into other areas, for example, it was first recorded along railways in Latvia in 1961 (NOBANIS 2009).","In Bulgaria sub-populations are reported to be generally small with data from 11–13 localities. Sub-populations near Varnensko lake and south of Zelenka Cape are more numerous with more than 500 individuals.

It is found in arable areas, grassland and steppe on alkaline, sandy and saline soils, in dry and mesophytic conditions. On the Black Sea coast it grows on damp clay and sandy, often salty soils and sometimes amongst coastal rocks. It also grows in man-made habitats, such as on the gravel between rail tracks at some railway stations (Petrova 2014). It flowers from July to October and it is noted to be pollinated by insects, particularly bees (Kozuharova and Gogala 2010).","Threats to this species in Bulgaria include developments in infrastructure, tourist developments and hydrological changes. Flowers are also picked for sale in the Varna town area (Petrova 2014). Tourist development is also a threat to its sandy coastal habitat in the Crimean peninsula (Drescher et al. 2007). In the Ukraine up to 88% of the steppe has been converted to agricultural use (Goriup 1998), which may have caused a loss of habitat, although this species is known to occur in arable areas and grasslands.","The species occurs in three Natura 2000 sites in Bulgaria (Pomerie, Besaparski Vazvishenia and Aheloy-Ravda-Nesebar; EUNIS 2010). Most of its localities in Bulgaria are in protected areas, such as the Kaliakra Strict Nature Reserve, Atanasovsko Ezero Strict Nature Reserve, Pomoriiski Solnitsi and Poda Protected Sites (Petrova 2014). It is also listed as a species of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve in Romania, in which country it is considered to be Vulnerable (Doroftei et al. 2011). It is a protected species in Bulgaria and considered to be Endangered (B1ab(ii,iii,iv)+2ab(iv)). Conservation measures recommended include enforcement of regulations for protected areas and prevention of wild collecting and also raising awareness of the threatened status of this species with flower traders and developers (Petrova 2014). Surveys and monitoring are needed, particularly in areas under threat. Seed has been collected and stored, for example in Cordoba, Spain (ENSCO 2014) and it is reported to be grown in eleven botanic gardens (BGCI 2013).

There are no conservation measures in place or needed.","It is used in traditional and well established medicine as herbal preparations from dry and liquid extracts used as an expectorant for coughs (European Medicine Agency 2011). Ivy berries and leaves are poisonous as they contain triterpene, sapogenin, hederagenin which if consumed in large quantities can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and nervous depression which are more serious in small children. However its gum can be chewed into carious teeth to relieve toothache (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003). The plant is used internally in the treatment of gout, rheumatic pain, whooping cough, bronchitis and as a parasiticide. The leaves are harvested in spring and early summer and are used fresh or dried. Recent research has shown that the leaves contain the compound 'emetine', an amoebicidal alkaloid and triterpene saponins, which are effective against liver flukes, internal parasites and fungal infections. An infusion of the twigs in oil is recommended for the treatment of sunburn (Plants for a Future 2012).","Khela, S."

Although widespread across Europe, it is widely collected and in many places is considered a rare and threatened plant; it is, however, protected in parts of its range, where collection from the wild is strictly forbidden and regulated by law. Commercially, its source as a raw material for medicinal value is limited and it is a target species for ex situ germplasm conservation (Baričevič et al. 2004).Populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation resulting from a multitude of factors, as well as high collection pressure, and as the entire plant is used this collection may have a significant impact. This plant is not in extensive cultivation and therefore it can be inferred that the population will continue to decline until further legislation to regulate or prohibit its collection from the wild, cultivation technology and site protection are established.This species is classified as Near Threatened approaching criterion A2cd on both the European and EU 27 levels, as collection pressure is high and populations are declining as a result of various threats, and the species is considered threatened or near threatened in many countries. The overall population decline has not been quantified and cannot be said to reach 30%, but is suspected to be at least 20%. It is not known whether populations from outside its European range could rescue declining European populations, as their status is unknown; the category therefore remains unchanged. More specific information on the current population size, trend and the overall rate of decline is needed, especially from countries in eastern Europe, to verify whether the species needs to be included in a higher threat category.",Decreasing,"Helichrysum arenarium is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia (Greuter 2006-2009, Baričevič et al. 2004). It is widespread across much of its European range, but has a small distribution in France and Bulgaria. In Ukraine it is said to have significant resources but limited distribution (Minarchenko 2011). Though the species is recorded from Slovenia (Greuter 2006-2009), other sources do not list it as present (Martinčič 2007). It is reported as collected in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Kathe et al. 2003), but other sources do not report its presence there (Greuter 2006-2009); the origin of these populations is thus uncertain.","Although it is widespread, the overall wild population of Helichrysum arenarium is declining. In Serbia the population contains over 250 mature individuals (Baričevič et al. 2004). The subpopulation in Croatia was recorded in several localities along the river Drava (northern Croatia) by Schlosser and Vukotinović (1869), but has not been found since then (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013). It is known from only 6-20 localities and is clearly declining in the Czech Republic (Grulich 2012). A significant decline is reported in Slovakia (V. Ferakova and I. Hodálová pers. comm. 2013), and it is clearly declining in Hungary (G. Király pers. comm. 2013). It is said to be declining across Central Europe (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012). In the 1990s, populations increased in parts of northern Europe due to an increase in abandoned sandy arable fields, which provided suitable habitat, but today the species has become more rare (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013).","Helichrysum arenarium is a rhizome perennial herb of the sunflower family, found in sunny places on dry sandy soils, abandoned fields, along waysides and in dry forests and thickets. This species has the ability to invade disturbed areas and is found on dunes, abandoned fields, soils deficient in minerals and nutrients and that are easily drained (Sawilska 2008, Sawilska et al. 2009). It is spontaneous in Lithuania, growing on dry, poor sandy soils (Radušienė and Judžentienė 2008). It is found in calcareous sand grassland and listed under ""st"">Habitats Directive Annex I habitat type codes: 6120 Xeric sand calcareous grassland and 6260 Pannonic sand steppe (European Environment Agency 2010).","Habitat loss is a significant threat, resulting from lack of grazing, abandonment of traditional agricultural practices, development, soil eutrophication from fertilizer (manure) and air pollution, displacement by non-native species, mining, and destruction of sites (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012, G. Király pers. comm. 2013). Collection of wild plants has also threatened the wild population, which is not large enough to satisfy the market demand (Baričevič et al . 2004). This plant is not in extensive cultivation and therefore it can be inferred that the population will continue to decline until further legislation to regulate or prohibit its collection from the wild, cultivation technology and site protection are established.","This plant is listed as Regionally Extinct in Luxembourg (Colling 2005), Critically Endangered in the Netherlands (van der Meijden et al. 2000) and in France (UICN France, FCBN and MNHN 2012), Endangered due to a combination of rarity and decline in the Czech Republic (Holub and Procházka 2000, Grulich 2012), Near Threatened in Estonia (eBiodiversity Estonia 2012) and Hungary (Király 2007), Least Concern in Denmark (NERI 2007), and Data Deficient in Croatia (Nikolić and Topić 2005). It is Endangered (3: gefährdet) in Germany where it is protected under the Federal Nature Conservation Act (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012). This species is under partial protection in Poland (Sawilska et al. 2009). It was considered an important threatened plant in former Yugoslavia (Baričevič et al. 2004). It is also endangered and rare in Austria (V. Ferakova and I. Hodálová pers. comm. 2013). It is not included on the Slovakian Red List, but should be as the number of sites it is found in is decreasing and significant decline is reported; it may be considered Vulnerable in Slovakia (V. Ferakova and I. Hodálová pers. comm. 2013). It is rare and considered to be Endangered in Bulgaria and is legally banned from collection, and is protected in Hungary. It is also protected throughout France under Articles 2 and 3 of the list of nationally protected plant species [Liste des espèces végétales protégées sur l'ensemble du territoire français métropolitain], where all destruction, collection, transport, gifting or sale of wild specimens is subject to authorization by the Ministry for the Protection of Nature (Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle 2003-2013).H. arenarium is recognised as a species with limited distribution suitable for ex situ collections and requiring preservation of genes in a seed bank (Angelova et al. 1994). In Lithuania, gathering from the wild has threatened the populations of this species and does not satisfy the market demand, so there is a need for its conservation and cultivation ex situ ; it is rather easily introduced and accepted for conservation in field collections, which hold ten accessions and show a wide range of variation of yield-related characters such as mass of inflorescens, number and colour of flowers and plant height (Baričevič et al. 2004). The high phenotypic variation of H. arenarium may allow selection of the most valuable accessions. The total estimated area over which it is cultivated in Latvia is 2 ha (Baričevič et al. 2004). In Estonia, it is listed under the Law of Natural Objects under Protection (passed in 1994, supplemented in 1998), which establishes the terms for the protection of both plant communities and plant species (Baričevič et al. 2004). In Bulgaria, gathering for trade is prohibited under special protection and use Ordinance no. RD-71/2007 (Evstatieva et al. 2007). It is found in 49 Natura 2000 sites in Germany, two in Romania and one in Belgium (European Environment Agency 2010). It is likely to be threatened in France where it is found in only a few states.","The plant is a source of valuable herbal material. At the beginning of the blooming period, the inflorescence contains a wide spectrum of flavanoids and has been reported to contain Asarone in its essential oil; however, this is considered to be toxic so the concentration in herbal medicinal products should be reduced to a minimum (European Medicines Agency 2003). In Poland, its inflorescence is collected at the beginning of the blooming period for medicinal preparations used for treatment of digestive system diseases. It is also used as a decorative and erosion-preventing plant. Previous attempts of cultivation in plantations have failed in Poland, as it can only tolerate a certain range of habitat conditions (Sawilska 2008, Sawilska et al. 2009). The chemical composition of essential oils has been investigated on wild populations of H. arenarium from the Caucasus region in Eastern Lithuania and Hungary, and vary in essential oil constituents (Radušienė and Judžentienė 2008). Helichrysum arenarium is one of the most commonly used plants in Lithuanian pharmaceutics (Baričevič et al. 2004). It is an A list priority for medicinal and aromatic cultivation and trade, collected from natural sites in Estonia, Lithuania and Sweden. In Montenegro, collecting and processing of wild plants is a long tradition. In Serbia, cultivation technology is unknown but the plant is sold on the Serbian market (Baričevič et al. 2004). In Herzegovina, where the entire dried plant and fresh herb for essential oil production is used, an estimated 35 tonnes of dried and 90 tonnes of fresh plants are collected (data from 2001; Kathe et al. 2003). In Ukraine the resource is described as limited in distribution but there is a large harvest of 10.1-50 tonnes per year of wild and harvested plants (Minarchenko 2011).","Khela, S."

As it is a species of open, semi-natural habitats, loss of these habitats as a result of progressive vegetative succession represents a major threat; in addition, seed viability is very low, thus the emergence of seedling is rare (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013). Soil erosion on cliffs and sand dunes could cause declines. Collection from the wild is also an ongoing threat, as this species is highly prized for its essential oil.","This was a target species for the Medicinal and Aromatic Plant Working Group of the South East European Development Network on Plant Genetic Resources. In Montenegro, it is a non-protected species free for gathering and trade (Lipman 2009). It is found in one biogenetic reserve and five Natura 2000 sites in Italy and one in Spain (European Environment Agency 2010). It is also found in several protected areas as well as Natura 2000 sites along the coast and on the islands in Croatia. Its distribution in Spain and France is small, and the populations in those countries should be monitored and, if necessary, protected. It can be considered Least Concern in Greece (I.

There is a need for survey and assessment of conservation status of wild populations at national levels, as well as harvest management to ensure it is sustainable.","This plant is eaten by European wild rabbits, and is prized by humans for its essential oil. The plant constituents and their use vary with origin of country, but the essential oil is mainly derived from plants in Corsica, Italy, France and Bosnia (Shutes 2013). The essential oil is available to buy from various companies on the world wide web, and is prized for its aromatherapy and used as a pain reliever to reduce chronic inflammation. The aerial parts or dried flower heads are known to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity (Sala et al. 2010). In Bosnia and Herzegovina it is one of the top ten most frequently collected medicinal and aromatic plants, with a market price of 12.60 KM per kg dried material; it is collected from the wild and is cultivated over a small area (Kathe et al. 2003). It is the most collected plant in Croatia for distillation and production of essential oil, and in the last few years demand has increased.

Hops (dried flowers) have also been used for phytotherapy to treat anxiety through sedation, the inflorescence contain complex volatile oil for nervousness and insomnia (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003). The ripe female cones are used for flavouring beer since the early nineteenth century. Hops is commercially important because it contains an a-acid that turns sweet ale into bitter beer and also acts as a preservative. It contains lupulon and humulon which are active against gram positive and acid fast bacteria and prevent bacteria from growing in beer. The a-acid is a major component of soft resins found in the lupulin gland on the hop flower; these glands are more plentiful on female flowers than on male flowers, and so female plants are more prized by commercial growers. Humulus lupulus has the highest concentration of lupulin glands, and therefore is far more commercially valuable (Blamey and Grey-Wilson 2003, Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003, Natural History Museum 2011).

In Romania it is very common in Transylvania but rare in most parts of the country (Badarau and Malos 2011).","Inula helenium is a perennial herb found in a variety of habitats, including damp meadows and shaded areas of central Europe (Bourrel et al. 1993); it can also be found in secondary habitats (G. Király pers. comm. 2013). In the United Kingdom it has naturalised from garden escapes and is found on road sides and woodland margins (Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012).","Collection of plants from the wild, particularly in eastern Europe, has caused regional declines.","This species is preserved within protective territories and collection from the wild is banned in many places across its range. In Italy it is included in the list of medicinal and aromatic plants cited in the Royal Decree n° 772 of 1932, which states the maximum quantity allowed to be harvested upon authorization is 2 kg (roots).

In Hungary it is listed as Near Threatened (Kiraly 2007), but is a protected species where it grows in the wild in Atlantic Evergreen Forests (Lipman et al. 2004). In Croatia, it was legally protected under the Nature Protection Act (Official Gazette 70/05, 139/08, 57/11) and listed in the Ordinance on Proclamation of Wild Taxa as Protected and Strictly Protected (Official Gazette 99/09). As a protected wild plant, it could have been collected for personal needs without authorisation, but its commercial collecting was regulated by the Ordinance on the Collecting of Protected Wild Plants for the Purpose of Processing, Trading and Other Types of Traffic (Official Gazette 154/08). However, it is currently no longer protected according to the new Nature Protection Act (Official Gazette 80/13) so there is a need for its exploitation to be regulated (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013).

This species is widespread but declining and/or threatened across most of its range. At the European level, although it has a large distribution in Ukraine with many localities and a stable population, the species has reportedly gone extinct in Serbia (though whether it occurred there is uncertain) and is threatened, near threatened and/or declining in all other countries of occurrence except Albania and Romania, where its status is unknown.Within the EU 27, Iris aphylla is found in nine countries and is threatened and/or declining in six of them (its status in Romania is unknown), comprising more than half of its range. The area of occupancy, the number of localities and whether they are fragmented is not known. It has disappeared from open steppe habitats and become isolated at the limits of its geographical range.The overall decline is mainly attributed to natural succession of open grassland into shrub and woodland; it is also threatened by invasion of Robinia pseudoacacia, logging of forest, burning, infrastructure development, industrial air and soil pollution, collection and competition. However, it can also occur in secondary habitats such as artificial woods and plantations, so may be able to adapt somewhat to moderate habitat transformation. Although the overall population decline has not been quantified as there is no specific information on population size, and though this species is protected in several countries, it is precautionarily assessed as Near Threatened approaching criteria A2cde, as it could likely have declined by 20% or more over the past 60-75 years, given that it is facing many threats and listed as threatened and declining across much of its range. No rescue effect is expected from outside its European range, as the only populations outside this range are on the far eastern side of the Black Sea and not likely to reach Europe. Furthermore, the species has been found to have extremely low seed set and number of juveniles due to limited pollen and seed dispersal, due to its highly fragmented distribution (Wroblewska and Brzosko 2006); if this pattern holds elsewhere in its range, immigration and establishment from outside Europe is highly unlikely. It is strongly recommended to collect detailed population information and decline rates from each country and to re-assess the species when all the data is available. It might then warrant listing in a more threatened category.",Decreasing,"Iris aphylla is native to central and eastern Europe, including the Carpathians and the Caucasus. Its distribution is not continuous and is fragmented over a large area, except in Ukraine and Russia. It is found in nine countries within the EU 27 with numerous disjunct localities (Witkowski et al. 2003, Wroblewska and Brzosko 2006). Some sources list this species as occurring in France and Italy, but a recent review of Irises concluded that the species found in France is Iris perrieri , while in Italy (and Austria) the species is Iris benacensis (Colasante and Mathew 2008). Its presence in Albania and Serbia is doubtful (G. Király pers. comm. 2013). It is also grown as an ornamental species in other parts of Europe (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013). In Russia, I. hungarica is reported from the Briansk region where the population covers an area of 100-300 m². In Ukraine, it has a large distribution in the forest-steppe zone, in the south of deciduous and mixed forests (in Polesian lowland) and in the northern part of the steppe zone. In Hungary, it is found in the northeast. The taxon is found in one locality in northeast Poland in the Northern Podlasie Lowland (Piękoś-Mirkowa and Mirek 2006). In Slovakia, it occurs in the Slovenský kras Karst (the Jasovská and Zádielska planina Plateaus), the Hornád Valley (from Hranovnica to Kysak), Spišská kotlina Basin (Dreveník NNR), Slánske vrchy Mts. (Fintice, Kokošovce) and hills on Východoslovenská nížina Lowland. Several localities, such as the occurrence in Burda, could not be confirmed recently (Mereďa and Hodálová 2011).","Many Iris aphylla subpopulations are found in isolated patches. In the Czech Republic, the species is rare (recently recorded at only 6–20 localities) and is declining in abundance. It has been reported from two localities in Bulgaria, but one has been completely destroyed and the species has not been confirmed in the other since 1976 ( Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). In Albania, it is known from Gryka e Shijes ( Kukesi District ) at 400 m (L. Shuka pers. comm. 2013). There are seven natural subpopulations in Poland and four reintroduced subpopulations, as many became extinct in the 19th Century. The mean population size of the seven natural subpopulations observed over three years was 9,609 ramets (the largest subpopulation was 2,510 and the smallest was 129), which included 277 flowering ramets (ranging from 85 to 4) and eight juveniles (five in the largest subpopulation and zero in three subpopulations) (Wroblewska and Brzosko 2006). This survey revealed extremely low seed set and number of juveniles due to limited pollen and seed dispersal, due to its highly fragmented distribution. The Hungarian populations of the subspecies I. a. hungarica have been estimated between 13,000-16,000 individuals and are slightly decreasing. In the Ukraine, the populations are found in isolated patches over a wide range; the trend is stable as there are still many localities. In Brianskaja region of Russia, the populations cover an area of 100-300 m². In Slovakia, it has been recorded in 29 localities (Commission of the European Communities 2009). The size of I. a. hungarica populations in Slovakia (numbering typically tens to hundreds of individuals) as well as their number have considerably decreased over the last decades (Mereďa and Hodálová 2011). In Poland the subspecies has become extinct in more than half of its localities. The extant populations comprise from a few to 3,000 flowering shoots, but in recent years the populations have decreased (Kaźmierczakowa and Zarzycki 2001).","Iris aphylla is a long-lived rhizomatous perennial herbaceous plant with violet flowers pollinated by insects. It is found in open calcareous grassland and steppe (Wroblewska et al. 2003), meadow-steppe communities and grasslands, and in pine forests and oak-pine forests. It can also occur in secondary habitats such as artificial woods with Robinia pseudoacacia (plantations). It is found on sunlit limestone, andesite, basalt and melaphyre slopes and rocks from lowlands to the submontane vegetation belt (Mereďa and Hodálová 2011). As a long-lived perennial, its generation length is at least 20-25 years (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013). Iris aphylla hungarica grows in the following Habitats Directive listed habitats (Commission of the European Communities 2009): 40A0 Subcontinental peri-Pannonic scrub 6210 Semi-natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates (Festuco-Brometalia) 6240 Sub-Pannonic steppic grasslands 6250 Pannonic loess steppic grasslands 91H0 Pannonian woods with Quercus pubescens 91I0 Euro-Siberian steppic woods with Quercus spp. 91M0 Pannonian-Balkanic turkey oak–sessile oak forests","The declines in this species are attributed to general forestry management and lack of grazing, natural succession and overgrowth by shrubs. A major threat is invasion of Robinia pseudoacacia , along with logging of existing forest, ploughing of the soils and then plantations, as the species needs light and can be outcompeted by other plants. It is also threatened by infrastructure development and industrial air and soil pollution ( Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). Minor threats include over-collection (Wroblewska et al. 2003) and burning. Forest plantations are the main threat for the Ukrainian steppe habitat, while in Slovakia it is threatened by intensive use of orchards and fallows in the vineyards. The loss of suitable habitats from encroachment by woody plants or herbs has been reported as a threat from Slovakia and Poland. Locally, rock mining is a threat. Habitat destruction and climatic changes since the 19th Century have also led to decline and range contraction from open habitats and the scarcity of suitable habitats, causing it to become more rare (Wroblewska and Brzosko 2006).","The species Iris aphylla (or subspecies I. a. hungarica ) is listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive and on numerous national red lists. It is reported as having gone Extinct in Serbia (Baričevič et al. 2004), though it is uncertain whether it was ever present in the country (G. Király pers. comm. 2013). It is Critically Endangered in Slovakia, where it occurs in 11 Natura 2000 sites covering 77.8% of its localities (Witkowski et al. 2003, Mereďa and Hodálová 2011). It is also Critically Endangered in Bulgaria (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009) where is protected under the Law for Nature Protection and occurs in ex situ collections, and has a very good adaptability to cultivation (Baričevič et al. 2004).

Some subpopulations occur in nature reserves and in the Biebrza National Park in Poland. It is listed as Vulnerable (VU D2) on the Red List of the Vascular Flora of France (UICN France, FCBN and MNHN 2012), and is also listed in the French Decree of 20 January 1982 establishing the national list of protected plants [Liste des espèces végétales protégées sur l'ensemble du territoire français métropolitain: Article 1], though the species present in France is likely to be Iris perrieri rather than Iris aphylla (Colasante and Mathew 2008). It has been categorized as Near Threatened in Russia, and is listed in the regional Red Data Books of the Russian Federation: Republics of Chuvashia and Tatarstan, Brianskaja region. In the Ukraine, it is not listed as a threatened species and is found in many protected areas; ex situ conservation measures are under way in the National Botanical Garden of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kyiv.

Iris sibirica is a characteristic species of summer-dry, continental Cnidion meadows, found mostly in large river floodplains in Moravia, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, which are regularly flooded for a few weeks every spring but where the water table can drop in summer to one metre below ground level or deeper; they are usually mown once or twice a year but never grazed (Šeffer et al. 2008). As a long-lived perennial, its generation length is at least 20-25 years (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013).","This species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused by overgrazing, overuse and draining/filling in of wetlands, flood control in floodplains, conversion of grassland into arable land, and afforestation of damp and wet meadows (Gabrielian 1988, Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012, Flora Croatica Database 2012). Changes in water regime and ceasing of mowing, which enables colonization by shrub vegetation and transformation of vegetation type, are also significant threats. Strong destruction and fragmentation of natural wet meadows has led to decreased population size and lowered genetic variability (Kostrakiewicz and Wroblewska 2008).","The species Iris sibirica is listed on numerous national red lists. It is Data Deficient on the Red List of the Vascular Flora of France (UICN France, FCBN and MNHN 2012), but is protected under the French Decree of 20 January 1982 establishing the national list of protected plants [Liste des espèces végétales protégées sur l'ensemble du territoire français métropolitain: Article 1]. It is Near Threatened in Belarus (Ermakova 2005), Estonia (eBiodiversity Estonia 2012) and Hungary (Király 2007), and Vulnerable in the Czech Republic (Holub and Procházka 2000, Grulich 2012), Lithuania (Rašomavičius 2007), Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002) and the Ukraine (Witkowski et al. 2003). Of the two subspecies found in Croatia, I. s. sibirica is listed as Vulnerable ( I. s. erirrhiza is not listed; Nikolić and Topić 2005). The whole genus Iris is legally protected in Croatia and noted in the Ordinance on Proclamation of Wild Taxa as Protected and Strictly Protected (Official Gazette 99/09); it is forbidden to collect or destroy strictly protected plants as well as to hold and trade them without explicit authority permission (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013). Iris sibirica has been reported extinct in the wild in Slovakia (Witkowski et al. 2003), but is listed as Vulnerable on the Red list of ferns and flowering plants of Slovakia (Feráková et al. 2001).

PLANTAE,TRACHEOPHYTA,LILIOPSIDA,LILIALES,IRIDACEAE,Iris,spuria,,,NO,NO,VU,A2ce,VU,A2ce,"European regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU)EU 27 regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU)Most of the native European distribution of Iris spuria lies within the EU 27. This species is rare and threatened throughout its range, and has already disappeared from one country. The species is declining across its range due to habitat loss and degradation, as well as ecological factors (including the effects of competitors) which have significantly reduced the germination and seedling establishment for further recruitment. Although there is not enough population data to quantify an overall population decline, given such widespread losses it suspected to have declined by at least 30% over the past 60-75 years. It is therefore classified as Vulnerable A2ce at the European and EU 27 levels.It is not known if individuals from outside the region arrive in any substantial quantity that could potentially rescue the regional population, but given the limited seed dispersal, poor success of restoration efforts and difficulties with regeneration, any such immigration is not expected to have much rescue impact; furthermore, the species is probably extinct or at least Critically Endangered in north Africa (E. Vela pers. comm. 2013). The category therefore remains unchanged.It is strongly recommended to collect detailed population information and decline rates from each country and to re-assess the species when all the data is available. Habitat protection and management is required to  mitigate increasing pressures from agriculture and hydrodynamics (flood  control, drainage).",Decreasing,"Iris spuria is native to north-central and central Europe, north Africa and western Asia; it has naturalised in the UK and Italy (Pašica 2003, Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012, RBG Kew 2012). It is reportedly native to Spain (RBG Kew 2012), but there do not seem to be any records of its occurrence there (Castroviejo et al. in prep, Anthos 2010).","The total population size is unknown. It is very rare in Germany (Bissels et al. 2006). It was known from just one locality in the Czech Republic, which has since gone extinct, and has disappeared from 4 out of six localities in Slovakia (Čeřovský et al. 1999). Remnant populations still exist in France along the northern Upper Rhine, though large scale restoration efforts of species-rich flood meadows where it occurs at sites of former arable fields have had poor success of seedling establishment (Norbert and Annette 2003). In Hungary it is more common, with more than 300 localities and an estimated more than 1 million individuals; there is no clear trend indicating it is declining in Hungary, and the situation in Romania may be similar (G. Király pers. comm. 2013).","Iris spuria is a rhizomatous geophyte found in alluvial meadows along large rivers, and growing in damp meadows and pastures associated with Cnidion. The success of seedling establishment is strongly influenced by regular flooding in the late spring and early summer to eliminate competitors (Norbett and Annette 2003). It is tolerant of high anthropogenic influence and partial drainage but is sensitive to regular mowing and saline soils (Zlinska 2006). In Sweden, it only occurs on brackish water seashores (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013). The Weevil Mononychus schoenherrii Kolenati develops on this plant (Gültekin and Korotyaev 2012). As a long-lived perennial, its generation length is at least 20-25 years (M. Aronsson pers. comm. 2013).","The plants are susceptible to human interference such as picking and burning (Pašica 2003). The frequency of mowing on this flood meadow plant affects seed establishment and the recruitment of seedlings (Bissels et al. 2006). Due to intensive agriculture in lowlands and lack of management, it has vanished in many localities (Zlinska 2006). Due to flood control, drainage, intensified use and conversion into arable land, such habitats have become extremely rare. Drought is a significant cause of seed germination failure, and reduced frequency of floods or fast-retreating flood water causes significant declines in the regeneration capability, as it facilitates invasion by other plants as well as reducing the dispersal capability (Norbert and Annette 2003). In France a strong long-term decline of these species has taken place since the 1920s as a result of intensiﬁed grassland management, drainage and conversion into arable land. Despite the restoration of suitable site conditions, the current occurrence of these species is restricted by dispersal limitation to remnant stands along ditches, paths and old meadows (Donath et al . 2006).","Iris spuria is listed as Regionally Extinct in Czech Republic (Holub and Procházka 2000), Critically Endangered in Slovakia (Čeřovský et al. 1999), Endangered in Germany (assessment from 1996; Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012) and Sweden (Gärdenfors 2010), and Near Threatened in Denmark (NERI 2007) and Hungary (Király 2007). In Slovakia, where it is Critically Endangered, it is known from six localities including the Komocín Nature reserve, Pohrebiste Nature Reserve and Kamenínske slanisko National Nature Reserve (Zlinska 2006). It is considered to be threatened in France, and large scale restoration efforts of species-rich flood meadows where it occurs at sites of former arable fields have had poor success of seedling establishment. Direct sowing of seeds is required for improved restoration and genetic variability (Norbett and Annette 2003). It is also rare in Serbia (Pašica 2003). It is considered to be threatened on a Central European scale (Schnittler and Gunther 1999). More specific information is needed on the population size and rate of decline across Europe.

The species is not confined to the highest region of the Alps but also occurs in the alpine zone, and is typical of plant communities on exposed ridges (Hörandl et al. 2011).","In the past, Edelweiss populations have declined as a result of collection in the wild. As with a number of alpine plants, climate change may be a long-term threat, capable of causing population declines in Europe's mountain habitats as it gradually transforms cold mountain habitats and their plant communities (Gottfried et al. 2012).","Edelweiss is listed as Endangered in Bulgaria (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009), where it is rare and has been propagated by seed for ex situ conservation (Kozuharova 2009).

Edelweiss has been cultivated successfully for flower and herb production in South Finland (Lipman 2009) and attempts at cultivation in Switzerland have been successful (the average fresh inflorescence yield was 1.3 kg/m² in the second year of cultivation). Edelweiss is a protected species in Switzerland, but the plant is being selectively bred in order to produce a commercial crop. The cultivar grows vigorously and abundantly and is now a source of raw material for cosmetic and food extraction. The flower has soothing properties and the powder, infusion or tincture have been used to treat rheumatic pain and in traditional use for diarrhoea and dysentery and as an astringent and tonic for coughs and most commonly as an antioxidant as the extracts contain tannins and flavonoids.

However, the population of this species has been noted to have declined over recent decades as a result of human impacts (Kedra and Bach 2005).","This lily grows from a bulb to 1.2 m in height. It propagates mainly by seed set from light, wind dispersed, seeds and less commonly by bulbils. It is pollinated by insects, notably hawk moths attracted by its scent and pollen rich flowers. It grows in open beech forest, forest edges, damp sub-alpine meadows and borders of pastureland up to 2,300 m and prefers calcareous soils (Persson et al 1998).","This is an attractive lily and may be subject to collection from the wild, for example in Romania (Marossy 2006), and this is a threat from which it receives legal protection in some countries within its range (Lear 1988).

There are parts where the species is abundant and does not face major threats such as in Ukraine and Russia. But in other parts of its range, the species is listed on national red lists as a loss of habitat is causing populations to decline. The species is a weak competitor and the abandonment of traditional land management, forest plantations and eutrophication lead to changes in vegetation and therefore affect Lycopodium clavatum.The species had a wide range of medicinal and cultural uses and should be monitored in order to prevent overharvesting becoming a threat.",Decreasing,"Lycopodium clavatum has a circumboreal distribution and isolated populations in tropical and subtropical mountains (Natural History Museum 2010). In the UK the species is mostly confined to upland sites in the west and north, or scattered on heaths in the south (Natural History Museum 2010). It can be found in several parts of European Russia: Central, Eastern, Northern, Northwestern and Southern European Russia and in Kaliningrad (I. Illarionova pers. comm. 2010). In Ukraine, Lycopodium clavatum is widespread in the zone of deciduous and mixed forests in the Polesian lowland, in the lesosteppe (forest steppe) zone and in the Carpathian Mountains. There are isolated localities in extrazonal pine forests in the steppe zone in Ukraine. The plant is relatively common in the Czech Republic, mainly on mountains, but also in river slopes. It is not very common at low altitudes. In Hungary, it is not common because of the low altitudes but only occurs sporadically in the western and northeastern part of the country. In the Baltic States, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, it is a rather common species in suitable habitats. It is rare in the central part of Lithuania because of the absence of suitable habitats (dry forests). In Switzerland, it is widespread but scattered and it occurs between 800 and 2,300 m asl. In Italy, it has been reported from more than 500 localities. There are populations of L. amonostagium in the North of Europe and when these species grow together some confusion may appear.","Lycopodium clavatum is common in the mountains but the populations are decreasing because this is a very slow growing species and it is affected by habitat loss. The parental generation needs about 20 years to produce offspring. Within a long-term and general scale, the population is rather stable but locally affected by some threats (V. Rašomavičius pers. comm. 2010). In Hungary, for example, there are still more than 100 localities but the number of localities and the populations have declining trend especially in the last 20 years. In Switzerland, each population covers a few square metre and could sometimes be formed by only one individual or by several. One single individual is able to cover a wide area and that makes it difficult to count the number of individuals. There is also a slight long-term decline. Forty locations were found after 1994 but there is no clear information about the real distribution nowadays.The Italian populations are also declining. In the Ukraine, the populations are big and stable. In 1960, up to 9.2 tons of Lycopodium clavatum spores were stored in Ukraine (Chikov 1980) and this shows the magnitude of this species in this country.","Lycopodium clavatum is a long living but slowly growing species. It is not a good competitor but a slow colonizer just able to compete successfully with short vegetation. It prefers relatively open and dry forests, montane grassland, open woodland, conifer plantations. It is also found in heathland of the class Nardo-Callunetea or at the ecotone of heath and forest. In the UK, it is confined to sandy heaths in lowland sites (Natural History Museum, 2010). It has been reported from the following Habitats Directive listed habitats (list not complete): 9050 Fennoscandian herb-rich forests with Picea abies 91T0 Central European lichen Scots pine forests","Lycopodium clavatum is mainly threatened by the loss of suitable habitat. Abandonment of traditional land uses such as grazing leads to natural succession processes and as the species is a weak competitor this leads to population declines. The species tends to establish on eroded areas such as the ones that have suffered clear cuttings. Even a decrease in the use of former military paths leads to succession and the disappearance of this species. Intensive agricultural activities on forests edges are another threat as they lead to eutrophication and this leads to a change in vegetation. Here again, Lycopodium clavatum can't compete if faced with the emergence of taller vegetation. Pollution and eutrophication can damage the mycorrhiza in symbiosis with this plant. For other species in this genus it has been reported and it could be a threat for this species as well. Due to reforestation projects, forest areas become larger and forest edges decrease. Dense forest plantations have dark undercanopies and this species needs light. In Lithuania, the main threat is its use as decoration, overall near the big cities, although this gathering is forbidden by national regulations. It is likely this regulations would stop the threat because of their transposition into administrative punishments. The species does not face threats in parts of its range such as Ukraine.","This species is listed under Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulation 318-2008. Live specimens of this species as well as dried and fresh plants, including, leaves, roots/rootstock, stems, seeds/spores, bark and fruits are subject to this regulation. The genus Lycopodium spp. is listed in the Annex V of the Habitat Directive. The species is listed on several national red lists: Critically Endangered in Luxembourg Endangered in Serbia (V. Stevanovic pers. comm. 2010) Vulnerable in Germany (level 3) Near Threatened in Estonia, Hungary and Switzerland The species is categorized as Least Concern in Russia (I. Illarionova pers. comm. 2010) and is not listed in the Ukraine and several other countries. However, the species is under national protection in various states such as Hungary, in some regions of France, in one region in Switzerland. Regulations for its commercial use are in place in Latvia and Lithuania. Its collection is regulated in Italy. It occurs in several protected areas throughout its range for example in Switzerland and the Czech Republic were collection of the species is forbidden. In terms of conservation measures needed, it is necessary to manage sites in a way that Lycopodium clavatum can compete with other vegetation, i.e. keep areas open, reintroduce grazing activities. Monitoring of the population trends is recommended.","The spores of Lycopodium clavatum are harvested from the cones and sold as Lycopodium Powder. This is used as an explosive in film and entertainment industries, as lubrication on condoms and surgical gloves, as cosmetic powder, as pill coating in the pharmaceutical industry and in homoeopathic medicine (Natural History Museum, 2010). In traditional medicine, the plant is used internally in the treatment of urinary and kidney disorders, rheumatic arthritis, gastritis, etc. and externally it is applied to treat skin diseases and irritations (Plants For A Future 2010). In the Baltic States, the plant is locally still used for medicinal purposes and collected near cities. It is also gathered for religious purposes as it is used to decorate churches during Easter because of its evergreen character (V. Rasomavicius pers. comm. 2010). In the Czech Republic, it can be collected for personal use if it is not within a protected area as the species is not protected. There is no indication about collections for high scale trade.

In France it is widespread, occurs in all departments except Aisne where it has not been recorded (Association Tela Botanica 2000-2010). In the UK Medicago sativa ssp. falcata is confined to East Anglia in England, however it also has a sparse and patchy distribution throughout the rest of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but these occurrences are recorded as alien (Preston et al . 2002). In Ireland Medicago sativa ssp. falcate occurs in only two localities in the west of the country and both of these occurrences are recorded as alien (Preston et al . 2002). In Denmark: both M. sativa ssp. falcata and M. sativa ssp. sativa occur within this country however only M. sativa ssp. falcata is native (P. Wind pers. comm. 2010).","The exact population size of wild Medicago sativa is unknown, but the species is considered common throughout its range and populations are stable. However, in the UK according to Preston et al . (2002), Medicago sativa ssp. falcata has declined in coastal areas due to habitat loss. It is also unable to cope with animal grazing and it can hybridise with M. sativa ssp . sativa - these factors also play a role in its decline (Preston et al . 2002).","M. sativa is rare in the wild, but specimens are generally found in open habitats, such as roadsides and field borders. However, these are frequently plants which have escaped from agriculture. It requires a soil pH of at least 6.0, and can be found growing up to elevations of 2,400 m (FAO 2010). When growing in coastal areas, M. sativa occurs on sandy and sandy-loam soil types, whereas in mountainous regions it tends to grow on clay and heavier clay-loam soil types. Generally Medicago species grow best on alkaline soils which are well drained (Bennett et al . 1998). M. sativa grows on moderately fertile calcareous soils, commonly in open habitats. It is found in dry semi-desert to agricultural land, and less frequently in scrub and woodland (Al-Atawneh et al . 2009). M. sativa is a perennial herb which flowers between May and July. It grows on many different soil types, but favours well-drained loamy soil and does not tolerate waterlogging or acid soils. It can tolerate an average annual rainfall of 1030 mm, temperatures between 4.3ºC and 28.5ºC, and soil pH between 4.3 and 8.7 (Duke 1981). In the UK Medicago sativa ssp. falcata is a lowland species with a preference for calcareous soils and sands; it grows on grassy heaths, sea-walls, roadsides and tracks (Preston et al . 2002).","There are no know specific threats to the wild forms of the species, apart from the unknown consequences of withspread hybridisation with the crop. Research by Al-Atawneh et al . (2009) suggests that M. sativa is not threatened.","M. sativa , as well as the majority of Mediterranean species of Medicago , has germplasm stored in numerous genebanks, notably the Australian Medicago Genetic Resources Centre (AMGRC) in Adelaide, Australia, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in the USA, and the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Syria (Prosperi et al. 2001). M. sativa ssp. falcata is classified as Least Concern (LC) in Denmark (Den Danske Rødliste 2010). EURISCO reports 4,084 germplasm accessions held in European genebanks, 250 of which are reported to be of wild or weedy origin. Of the wild accessions, 194 originate from within Europe (EURISCO Catalogue 2010).","In its none wild form, M. sativa (alfalfa) is primarily grown as animal feed, either as high quality fodder or for direct grazing. It is often dehydrated to form pellets, which are then used as a nitrogen supplement for dairy animals and non-ruminants. However, it has a number of beneficial uses in soil which could potentially be improved using wild types, such as nitrogen fixation, soil stabilisation and soil enhancement. It can also aid in lowering water tables, reducing the salinity of drylands and reducing nitrate leaching, as well as providing a disease or weed break in the process of crop rotation (Prosperi et al . 2001). Furthermore, wild types of M. sativa could be potential gene donors to cultivated alfalfa, M. sativa ssp. sativa .","Osborne, J."

The plant is collected from the wild for its many medicinal and culinary qualities, but is also widely cultivated; the overall population trend in the wild is unknown. In the Iberian Peninsula it is widespread and common (Anthos 2010, Castroviejo et al. 2010). It is relatively widespread in France, though the population appears to be more concentrated in the north-central and north-western part of the country, with records scarce in the south and east (Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle 2003-2013). It is present in all regions in Italy, though determining whether the populations are native or escapes from cultivation is difficult (Lipman 2009, Vitalini et al. 2009). In Bulgaria it is widely spread throughout the country up to 1,000 m asl, though its populations are mainly found in limited areas, with small size and low density (Lipman 2009).

In various habitats in Bulgaria, wild populations have only been found in very small and scattered areas due to increased collecting and use (Lipman 2009). Climate change and its associated ecological disruptions may prove to be a future threat, especially in combination with widespread anthropological threats affecting habitats and species across Europe (Abrahamyan et al. 2011).","This plant is not listed on any European national red list. In Italy it is relatively widespread and occurs in the Valvestino area, recognized by the European Union as a 'Site of Community interest', which has allowed the preservation of the ethnobotanical traditions (Vitalini et al. 2009). It is a protected species in Italy under the Royal Decree no 772 of 1932, and the harvest is regulated. It is legally protected in Croatia and listed in the Ordinance on Proclamation of Wild Taxa as Protected and Strictly Protected (Official Gazette 99/09) (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013).

Caldas pers. comm. 2013). This species is widely cultivated (e.g. in Bulgaria, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Denmark and Finland). Vegetative propagation is carried out in situ in Portugal, while the Slovenian Medicinal and Aromatic Plant genebank carries out maintenance of germplasm as seed, in vitro and in vivo collections and seed propagation for cultivation purposes (Baričevič e t al. 2004). Microclonal propagation and biotechnological conservation methods have been developed for this species, among others, in Hungary (Baričevič e t al. 2004).As of 2009, there were three samples in the Suceava Genebank collection in Romania; in Serbia, there is a quota in force as well as two accessions deposited in the National Gene Bank of Serbia and Montenegro (Lipman 2009). According to the European Internet Search Catalogue, there are a total of 161 accessions, of which less than ten are from its native range (European Internet Search Catalogue, accessed 2013). Given its biological and chemical diversity, importance for medicinal plant production and interest in its genebank conservation, it was one of the ten priority medicinal and aromatic plant species selected for development of descriptors for in situ and ex situ conservation by the ECPGR Working Group on Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (Baričevič e t al. 2004). <span class=""hps","Melissa officinalis is used in traditional herbal medicine as an herbal substance, herbal preparation, dry extract and as an herbal tea prepared from the dried aerial parts for the relief of mild symptoms of mental stress and insomnia, fevers and colds, and the treatment of mild gastrointestinal complaints (European Medicines Agency 2007, Plants for a Future 2012). The leaves and young flowering shoots are antibacterial, antispasmodic, antiviral, carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, emmenagogue, febrifuge, sedative, and tonic (Plants for a Future 2012). The essential oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (Mimica-Dukic et al. 2004). An infusion of the leaves is used for nervous and heart diseases in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Redzic 2007). In the Iberian Peninsula, it is used to make the famous Agua del Carmen, a liquor used to treat the physical and emotional symptoms of nervousness and hysteria (Castroviejo et al. 2010). The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, and are used to flavour foods and alcoholic beverages, and made into a tea. It is also used to inhibit thyroid activity, treat cold sores, insect bites, gout, and as an insect repellent (Plants for a Future 2012). The essential oil contains citral and citronella, and is used in aromatherapy. This is one of the wild plants collected in the largest quantities for export in Bulgaria, where the raw materials are provided mainly from industrial plantations as its natural resources are not concentrated in large areas (Baričevič et al. 2004, Lipman 2009). It is one of the medicinal and aromatic plants of greatest importance in Hungary, where it is cultivated (Lipman 2009). It is also one of the main medicinal and aromatic species cultivated in Poland and in Spain; there are 12 accessions in Czech Republic for cultivation, and is cultivated over 100-300 ha in Serbia (Baričevič et al. 2004). It is cultivated in Austria; in 2005, it was cultivated over 25 ha, both traditionally (10 ha) and organically (25 ha) (Lipman 2009). In Italy, the harvest quantity permitted is 5 kg of flowered tips and leaves; all Melissa officinalis processed in Italy comes from cropping (Lipman 2009). In Denmark, there has been an increased production of potted plants as a fresh supply of spices and herbs (Baričevič et al . 2004), and it is also present in herb gardens in Finland (Lipman 2009). According to the database on commercial collecting of protected plants in Croatia, from 2005-2012 there were 28 requests to collect aerial parts (including flowers and leaves, sprouts and buds) of this species; around 50 kg were reported to have actually been collected, though these data are not updated (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013). Since 2003, several field trials have been set up in Croatia to characterize and evaluate accessions (Lipman 2009). In Portugal, while it is not one of the most important medicinal and aromatic plant species (in terms of volume) collected from the wild for commercial use, it is one of the ten most representative species in cultivation; 700 kg dry matter were produced over 0.25 ha in 2012 as part of a project to foster business development in the aromatic and medicinal plant sector in Portugal (Barata et al . 2013). It is present in ex situ collections in Latvia, is cultivated in Romania, and cultivation is being established in Malta (Lipman 2009).

In Denmark it is rare and declining because of forestry activities and conversion of areas for cultivation (Øllgaard and Tind 1993).","This fern is listed from 121 Natura 2000 sites in many countries, for example France, Italy, Finland and Poland. It is found within protected areas, such as, the Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, Finland (IUCN 2010). In Machowa, near Pilzano, in Poland, a floristic reserve was created for this species (Stachurskka-Swakon and Towpasz 2008). It is conserved ex situ in 150 botanic gardens worldwide but it is not known whether any spores are stored (BGCI 2013). It is assessed as Vulnerable in the Red Lists for Switzerland and Hungary (Zoological Society of London 2014) and in Slovakia and Denmark (Øllgaard and Tind 1993, Feráková, et al. 2001). It is considered endangered in Germany and protected by the Federal nature Conservation Act (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2014).Further research may be needed to enumerate population size and trends, particularly in areas where this species is less common and considered threatened. Management of some protected areas may be needed, for example, in the reserve in Machowa in Poland it is noted to be threatened by invasive species and lowering of the water table (Stachurskka-Swakon and Towpasz 2008).","This fern is considered edible, the rootstock can be peeled an roasted. The young fronds, known as fiddle-heads, before they unroll can be cooked and eaten as a delicacy and substitute for asparagus or eaten raw in salads. They are canned and are particularly popular in Canada (Øllgaard and Tind 1993). It is possible that it may contain some undesirable chemical compounds and is considered by some only as a famine food. The leaves are cut for fodder in Scandinavia as the stems have starch rich bases but it is only used when other fodder is scarce (Øllgaard and Tind 1993). A decoction of the leaf stalk base from sterile fronds has been used in folk medicine to treatment back pain and to help speed the expulsion of the afterbirth (Plants for a Future 2014). It is a popular garden plant for moist shady areas as it has and attractive shape and decorative fronds.","Chadburn, H."

It is suspected that they may be similar to Paeonia mascula , which occurs in many countries in common with this species, where its habitat is threatened by afforestation, for example with plantations or abandonment of pastures and their overgrowth with trees and shrubs. Studies have shown that P. peregrina thrives best in sunny conditions at woodland edges, where it produces more flowering stems and more seeds than in open areas or more densely shaded woodland. This type of habitat is under threat in Bulgaria and other parts of the northern Mediterranean region, because of the decline in traditional woodland management which allows colonisation of open areas with shrubs and trees (Borisova and Simonson 2014). In some places the flowers may be picked or the transplantation of whole wild plants into gardens may occur (Petrova 2014). It is also threatened by collection of the roots for medicinal purposes in Bulgaria (Borisova and Simonson 2014).","This peony is listed as present in 25 Natura 2000 sites, such as the designated National Park area of Piano di Marco in Italy (EUNIS 2014). It is grown ex situ in 77 botanic gardens worldwide (BGCI 2013). It is assessed as Critically Endangered in Moldova (Andreev 2004) and included in the National Red List for Romania. It is widely distributed and not protected or considered threatened in Bulgaria (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences 2011, Metodiev 2006-7). A long-term applied research and monitoring programme is underway at one site in Bulgaria which aims to monitor the population size and dynamics, and habitat changes and management strategies, in relation to this species (Borisova and Simonson 2006).","This peony is cultivated in gardens and widely available in trade from cultivated sources. It is believed that root extracts have medicinal properties. In Bulgaria it has similar uses to other Paeonia species that are used in Chinese medicine. It is thought to be analgesic, anti-inflammatory and sedative and a recent study found that it has some anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties (Ivanova et al. 2002).","Chadburn, H."

Unlike the related opium poppy ( P. somniferum ) it is non-addictive. However it contains alkaloids and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified herbalist. The flowers and petals have hypnotic, slightly narcotic and sedative properties. An infusion can be taken internally for treating bronchial complaints and coughs, insomnia, poor digestion, nervous digestive disorders, minor painful conditions and jaundice. The latex in the seedpods is also a narcotic and slightly sedative and can be used in very small quantities as a sleep-inducing drug but caution is advised.

PLANTAE,TRACHEOPHYTA,PINOPSIDA,PINALES,PINACEAE,Pinus,mugo,,"This species has received more names than any other conifer, some of these are still in use especially in eastern Europe. For a comprehensive list of synonyms see Farjon (2001). Here, only two subspecies are recognized in the species: the typical subspecies, subsp. mugo and subsp. rotundata . The closely related species P. uncinata is treated as distinct at that rank. The typical subspecies (subsp. mugo ) is relatively widespread and is not regarded as threatened. However, subsp. rotundata has a more restricted distribution and is confined to mid-elevation peat bogs. Draining and afforestation have reduced its area of occupancy to such an extent that it has been assessed separately.",YES,NO,LC,,LC,,"Global and European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)As this pine is widespread, with a large extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO) and population, and in most cases occurs in areas where it is not threatened by human activities, and has few significant declines, it is assessed as Least Concern. Pinus mugo subsp. rotundata has a much more limited distribution and is restricted to mid-elevation peat bogs. Habitat loss due to afforestation and draining has resulted in a reduction in its AOO and this subspecies has been assessed as Endangered. However, as this subspecies represents a relatively small part of the global population of Pinus mugo, the overall assessment for the species does not change.",Stable,"This pine is recorded from the French Alps, northern and central (an isolated population in the central Italian Apennines) Italy, Austria, Switzerland, southern Germany, Czech Republic, southern Poland and Slovakia. In southeastern Europe it is found in northern Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, western Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and east to the Ukraine. It is a montane species with concentrations in the Alps and Carpathians (Frankis and Earle 1999, Schmidt 2011, Farjon and Filer 2013, USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program 2014).",This pine is very common at and above the treeline in montane areas and the population is inferred to be large and stable.,"The species has two principal growth forms, commonly recognized as distinct taxa: a shrub-like, sometimes nearly decumbent form (subsp. mugo ) and an upright shrub or erect tree (subsp. rotundata ), which occupy different habitats. The shrubby form grows on mountain slopes and ridges generally from about 1,000 m to 2,300 m a.s.l. in the mountain ranges of Europe most exposed to storms associated with depression systems in the North Atlantic. Especially in the Carpathians, it forms dense mat-like thickets above montane forests dominated by Fagus or Picea ; in the western Alps the upright form (subspecies) dominates on nutrient poor slopes. Pinus mugo in the eastern Alps may have replaced original Larch-Arolla pine woods which were disturbed by human activities and grazing of their animals. The species often occurs on dolomite limestone, but is in fact indifferent to soil type; this prevalence probably has historical reasons. While upright stands of P. mugo subsp. rotundata can have fairly rich plant communities, the species associated with the decumbent subsp. mugo are much fewer due to harsh environmental conditions, such as exposure and long-lasting snow cover. P. mugo subsp . rotundata occurs mostly in and around peat bogs and its habit, from shrub to upright tree, seems to depend on soil drainage with the low shrub form in wet moor habitat. ","No significant, range wide threats have been identified for this species or for P. mugo subsp. mugo . Tourist and recreation-related developments (e.g. ski resorts and ski runs) could have some effect at a very localized level and acid rain in the eastern parts of its range may also be a problem (Boratynsky et al . 2009). Pinus mugo subsp. rotundata has a more limited distribution than the typical subspecies and is also restricted to peat bogs. Many of these have been drained and afforested with Picea abies . As a result this subspecies has been assessed as Endangered (see the assessment for further details).","This species is recorded from more than 50 Natura 2000 protected areas throughout its range (EUNIS 2014), such as Tatry National Park in Poland. It has been planted ornamentally and it is conserved ex situ in 154 botanic gardens worldwide (BCGI 2013). Seed is conserved in seedbanks, such as in Paver, Italy (ENSCO 2014). The subspecies rotundata is in need of conservation action (Farjon 2013).","The shrubby subspecies of Dwarf Mountain Pine has been used in some parts of northern Europe to stabilize drifting sand dunes and as initial shelter belts for plantations with Scots Pine in similar sandy areas. In horticulture it is mainly planted in spaces created by roundabouts and other types of road intersection, both in Europe and in the USA. For gardens many cultivars that remain more dwarfish than the subspecies mugo have been and are being selected, and some of these are suitable in larger rock gardens as they grow very slowly. For this reason this species has also been used in bonsai culture. The tree form (subsp. rotundata ) is too uncommon and also grows too slowly to be of importance as a timber tree. Its horticultural interest is limited to arboreta, where it is often labelled as a distinct species ( P. uncinata ) and can grow into an erect small tree. Hybrids have been described between subsp. mugo and subsp. rotundata , and such plants may also occasionally be in cultivation. As with other pines, this species produces a resin that has some medicinal uses. The turpentine obtained from the resin of all pines is considered antiseptic and diuretic. It is used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic disorders. In the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers it is also used for respiratory complaints such as coughs and colds and a variety of skin problems, such as sores and boils. An essential oil obtained from the young twigs is used medicinally and also in woody perfumeries.A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood. Pitch could also be obtained from the resin and a tan or green dye obtained from the needles and the wood has reportedly been used to make shoes (Plants for a Future 2014).

It is assessed as Least Concern.,Increasing,"This pine is found in southwest and southern Europe (France (Atlantic coast, Mediterranean coast, Corsica), Gibraltar, Italy (Sardinia, Sicily, and primarily the west coast of the mainland), Malta, Monaco, Portugal and Spain. The typical subspecies ( P. pinaster subsp. pinaster ) occurs in France, Spain and Portugal. Its natural distribution within these areas is uncertain due to its long history of cultivation. Pinus pinaster subsp. escarena has a fragmented distribution, partly on the west Mediterranean coast from Malaga in southern Spain to Messina in Sicily, and partly further inland in France and especially in Spain, where it merges with subsp. pinaster further northwest (Frankis 1999, Farjon and Filer 2013). It has been widely planted in other parts of the world with a Mediterranean climate, and is now naturalized in South Africa and elsewhere (Frankis 1999). Outside Europe, the species is known from north Africa; Morocco, and along the border between Algeria and Tunisia.",This pine is a widespread and common species which is increasing in abundance as it often naturalizes from planted populations (Farjon and Filer 2013).,"This pine grows to about 20 m in height and is mainly found in low-lying, coastal plains, usually on sandy soils of sea shore dunes and flats but can occur in inland in rocky hills. Centuries of extensive planting, for example in sand dunes, has established this species in areas where it may not have occurred naturally but where it has subsequently often been naturalized. It can form tall pine forests and, with open crowns, can have an understorey of evergreen maquis shrubs or it can occur in evergreen oak woodlands. This species is frost sensitive, which is probably a reason why only in the far south of its range it ascends into the mountains (Farjon and Filer 2013).","Residential, urban, industrial and tourism related developments in coastal areas has reduced the available habitat for this species. However, this decline is offset by its naturalization in other areas. Pests such as Matsococcus feytaudy may be problematic locally and increases in the frequency of wildfires may affect isolated populations, and the introduction of Pinus pinaster material from different parts of its range could lead to the loss of local adaptations through hybridisation (Alía and Martín 2003).","This species is present in several protected areas, for example Isola di Pantelleria reserve in Italy and six other Natura 2000 sites (EUNIS 2014). Seed is conserved in seedbanks, such as in Soller, Spain (ENSCO 2014).","Maritime Pine is an important timber tree as well as Europe's major source of turpentine since the 16th Century. It has been planted to stabilize dunes in coastal areas within as well as far outside its natural range where frost is a minimal risk due to the maritime influence on the microclimate. The region Les Landes in SW France is one of the principal areas where this pine has been planted for forestry purposes, including resin tapping. Another centre for resin production is Corsica. The species has also been planted on a forestry scale in many parts of the Mediterranean region. The wood is of coarse grain and very resinous. It has been used for mining pit props, construction, telephone poles and posts for fencing, boat-building, and furniture. Smaller sized logs with many knots or blemishes are usually chipped or pulped for particleboard and paper. The large volume of bark per unit of wood makes this a pine suitable for production of mulch. Resin is extracted by tapping as well as distillation of bark and wood pulp, and used to produce turpentine, pitch, oils, varnishes, waxes and soap (Farjon 2010). A tan or green dye can be obtained from the needles. The cones are sold as Christmas decorations. The seeds may be eaten raw or cooked and a vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood. The turpentine obtained from the resin of all pines is considered antiseptic and diuretic. It is used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic disorders.

It has a large population size and few significant threats or ongoing declines. It is assessed as Least Concern.,Stable,"This pine is widespread across Eurasia from western Europe to the Russian Far East and from Lapland in the north to Turkey (Anatolia) in the south. In Europe it is native to Scotland (but introduced throughout the British Isles; Preston et al. 2002), Norway, Sweden and Finland, central European countries, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal (possibly extirpated). In southeast Europe it is found in the Balkan region and Greece and eastward to Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, the Russian federation (throughout European Russia), Belarus and Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia (Farjon 2010, Farjon and Filer 2013, GRIN 2014). It is a mountain species in western Europe and occurrences in lowlands (outside Sweden and the Baltic coast) are naturalized, for example in the Netherlands. Natural lowland occurrences begin to appear from eastern Germany and continue further east as the climate becomes more continental (Farjon and Filer 2013).",The population of this pine is very large and inferred to be stable as it is locally abundant and dominant in many areas.,"This large and long lived pine grows naturally in a variety of habitats, the common denominator of which is deficiency of nutrients in the soil. Thus on the Atlantic seaboard of Scotland and Norway up to 70o N, it occurs in areas with very heavy precipitation and on thin soils overlying ancient igneous or metamorphic rocks. South of the Baltic Sea it grows on podsoloized glacial sands left after the last Ice Age. In the central Alps it is restricted to the drier slopes and valleys below other conifers like Larix and Picea . In Scandinavia and north east Europe it often borders acidic peat bogs. It most commonly forms open pine forests and woodlands but in many areas it is associated with conifers like Picea , Larix , Juniperus and with broad-leaved trees, especially Betula spp. and Populus tremula . In old growth stands there is often a well developed ground cover of Vaccinium spp. or Empetrum nigrum in Atlantic regions, and such pine forests are rich in mycorrhizal fungi.","Populations along the southern parts of its range, especially in areas such as the Iberian peninsular may be susceptible to impacts such as changes in precipitation patterns, recurrent droughts and an increased frequency of wildfires associated with climate change (Garzón et al. 2008, Mátyás et al. 2004). Across the whole of its range, there are currently insufficient threats for this species to be considered threatened at any level.","As this species has such a wide range and is relatively common, it is present in numerous protected areas such as the Cozia National Park in Romania and 29 other Natura 2000 sites (EUNIS 2014). However, few of these include the more isolated subpopulations that often occur at the margins of its range or in more extreme habitats and probably represent reservoirs of genetic adaptability. Most ex situ conservation activities such as seed banks and seed orchards are orientated towards tree breeding for timber production rather than broad genetic representation. A more comprehensive strategy is required to conserve the full range of genetic variability and the range of habitat types that this species characterises (Mátyás et al. 2004).","Scots Pine is an important timber tree, but most of the production goes to the paper industry. In the past it was more often put to use as mining props and for interior construction; such uses are still common in eastern Europe. Most of the 'pine' used for furniture in western Europe is actually spruce ( Picea abies ), which has a smoother grain and is less resinous, but often has more and darker 'knots', which are the discarded lower branches on the trunks of densely planted trees. Other uses of Scots Pine wood are (or were) street paving blocks, railway sleepers, fencing, crates, pallets, boxes, laminated wood, particleboard, fibreboard, and various wood-based materials also resin, turpentine and pitch and their various by-products. In Russia and Scandinavia resin is extracted by 'destructive distillation' from the stumps and roots of felled trees to produce 'Stockholm tar' which is used as a wood preservative. In much of western Europe it is a widely planted forestry tree for timber; it was introduced in the USA for similar purposes and for growing as Christmas trees. Scots Pine is, or was, also used to stabilize dunes, but not those close to the sea as it is not very resistant to salt-laden winds. In Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark such plantations have led to massive spontaneous spread of pines onto heathland and the last remaining inland dune areas, and while the old plantations have in many places matured to mixed woodland now managed as 'multiple use' or even nature reserves, its invasiveness into Calluna heathland is sometimes seen as a menace to biodiversity of an ancient semi-natural landscape. In horticulture a large number of cultivars are known, including dwarf forms; the species is being planted as an amenity tree in many countries. The bark of the tree can be ground to make a flour which is used as an emergency food and a vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood. A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles and a orange dye from the cones. It is used medicinally in the treatment of chest and urinary complaints, rheumatism and arthritis. It is used in various forms, such as the turpentine from the resin and oil from the seed and leaves.The leaves and young shoots are considered antiseptic, diuretic and expectorant and are harvested in spring and dried for later use. Leaves can also be added to bath water for treating fatigue, sleeplessness and skin irritations. It is used in aromatherapy for its invigorating properties. The oil from the leaves is also used in perfumery. A fibre from the bark has been used to produce ropes and the leaves as a packing material. The roots are resinous and can be used as a candle substitute and the wood use as a fuel (Plants for a Future 2014).","Gardner, M. & Chadburn, H.,Gardner, M. & Chadburn, H."

The recent taxonomic revision by Al-Saghir and Porter (2012) creates the subspecies Pistacia lentiscus L. subsp. emarginata (Engl.) Al-Saghir that extends the distribution of the species to eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania). In the European region, the species is considered native to Macaronesia (Canary Islands), most Mediterranean coastal countries and larger islands (Spain (including the Baleares), Portugal, France (including Corsica), Italy (including Sardinia and Sicily), Croatia, Albania, and Greece (and Crete) (GRIN 2014).","No detailed population data are available. However, as this shrub is a characteristic species of maquis vegetation and open rocky areas around most of the Mediterranean and its island, the population is inferred to be very large. Palacio (2005), for example studied just one natural population of this shrub, located in north east Spain, which had more than 300 adults. There are more than 20,000 records for this species in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2013) with a very large number from Spain and many records from France and Greece. It is reported to be extremely common in Crete, common in Sardinia and along the coast of Italy (Fielding and Turland 2005, Delfino 2010, Pignatti 1982). Grove and Rackham (2001) suggest there may be some recent expansion of this species within Mediterranean Europe.","This dense evergreen shrub, or less commonly, small tree, forms part of what is thought of as typical Mediterranean vegetation of thick-leaved evergreen maquis . It is also found in more open steppe, on dry rocky slopes and is common near the sea, sometimes on sand dunes, and in open oak forest (Blamey and Grey-Wilson 1993, Al-Saghir and Porter 2012). In the interior of the Iberian Peninsula it grows in low-altitude scrublands (garrigas) and sheltered areas, avoiding places with cold winters (Palacio 2005). The species is noted to be deep-rooted and long-lived (more than 100 years), relatively combustible, but with a good ability to survive fire and also an ability to tolerate some degree of wood-cutting. It is also noted to be an unpalatable shrub which may confer protection from grazing (Grove and Rackham 2001). It has been noted to have a transient seed bank with rapid germination of seedlings within the year (Garcia-Fayos and Verdu 1998). It is a dioecious species, with separate male and female plants.","This species suffers only from the general threats associated with expanding human populations and associated habitat loss and disturbance, for example, sub-populations may be affected by tourist developments in Mediterranean coastal area and the extension of areas of cultivation under plastic, such as in the south of Spain. However, these threats are suspected to be at a local scale only and not to have significant impacts on the the overall population.","The germplasm of this shrub is conserved within the United States Genetic Resources Programme (GRIN 2014) and it is grown in botanic gardens, for example the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, Missouri Botanic Garden and Copenhagen's University Arboretum (GBIF 2013). It occurs in protected areas within its range such as Coto Donana National Park in Spain and Parco Nazionale del Gargano in Italy, and Parc Regional de Camargue (specimen data).","This shrub produces an aromatic resin known as mastic which has a long history of use, for example, it is noted to have been used in ancient Egypt as part of the embalming process (Hanelt et al. 2001). It has also been used in the production of varnishes and adhesives, for chewing gum, in photography, lithography and dentistry and it is used in liqueurs and cordials (Polunin 1969). The mastic oil is also part of distinct perfumes, hair and skin lotions and the resin is also used in a number of cakes, pastries, sweets and desserts and is an important ingredient in Greek festival breads (Hagidimitrio 2013). The seeds contain about 25% oil, which is used as salad oil, and the wood can be used to produce charcoal, and the branches are used by basket makers (Hanelt et al. 2001). There has been recent interest in its medicinal properties and the oil and gum are natural antimicrobial agents and possibly have some anti-fungal properties (Iauk 1996). Anti-ulcer (Al-Said 1986) and anti-tumour activity has also been investigated and a possible future role in cancer prevention suggested (Magkoutaa et al. 2009). This species is cultivated for the extraction of mastic on the Greek Island of Chios. The production of mastic in 1997 was said to amount to 160–170 tonnes annually and to be important to the economy of the island, being the main source of income for about 20 villages in the south (Browicz 1987). It is thought that Chios is the main source of mastic for commercial use. It is not known to what extent other wild populations are utilized.","Chadburn, H."

Whilst in central-southeastern Europe it has an apparently patchy distribution and populations there have declined and the species is considered possibly extinct in Romania, in European parts of Russia the species populations are considered likely to be more stable and declines are not thought to approach the threshold for a threatened category, and it is considered Least Concern for the European regional assessment.The population declines observed within the EU27 member states in central-southeastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary) in the past were caused by irreversible habitat destruction and pasture management changes (Badarau and Malos 2014). In 1978, at least 15 populations were known in these three countries; these were reduced to only three by the mid-2000s (in Hungary and Bulgaria, with the species considered possibly extinct in Romania; Schneider-Binder 1978, Vidéki and Máté 2003, Tzonev et al. 2007).The species has a very restricted EOO (5,000 km2) and AOO (500 km2) and the past threats are very likely to still occur, and the number of locations are 1-2 (based on the primary threat of habitat loss driven by agricultural development). The species qualifies therefore for criteria B and is assessed as Endangered (B1ab(I,ii,iii,iv)+2ab(I,ii,iii,iv) in the EU27 member states. Moreover, the low number of populations in the EU and ongoing threats could drive the taxon to Critically Endangered or extinct in a very short time, which qualifies the species also for Vulnerable (D2).Several protective action plans are planned for the Bulgarian population (T. Karakiev pers. comm. 2014). Similar actions have been undertaken in Romania, which did unfortunately not prevent its probable extirpation there (Badarau and Malos 2014).",Decreasing,"The species is Boreal in origin, distributed across the meadow-steppe grasslands of eastern Europe (Schneider-Binder 1978, Missouri Botanic Garden 2014), Russia (Volga regions to East Siberia; Tinkov et al. 2014), northwestern China (Xinjiang), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The species is expanding westwards and northwards in Central Asia and Siberia (A. Shipunov pers. comm. 2014). Within the European region, the species is known from throughout much of European Russia (e.g, Samara Oblast (Mitroshenkova 2014); Belyaevsky District, Orenburg Oblast (Shipunov 2014); Volgograd and surrounds (Wulf 2009)). Shipunov (1998) records the distribution in Russia as predominantly found in southern parts, but extending to 47oNorth, and not found in the Pre-Caucasus to the south; introduced to some areas in Russia (e.g., Baltic Sea region and St. Petersburg). In Central Europe there are apparently isolated populations in Hungary (Vidéki and Máté 2003), Romania (Tzonev and Karakiev 2007; i.e., the Depresiunea Sibiului, near Sibui, central Romania, however populations are considered lost from here (Ianovici et al. 2010)) and Bulgaria (i.e., the Dragoman Marsh Karst Complex Ramsar site; Ramsar 2011). RBG Kew (J. Osborne pers. comm. 2014) holds an old (19 century to mid 20th century) specimen from France ('Montpellier'); this location is some way outside the species main range and identification requires confirmation.","The species is much more common in the eastern parts of its range than it is in Central Europe, although nowhere as commonly found as P. major or P. media. (A. Shipunov pers. comm. 2014). Data for European parts of Russia are limited. The species was considered 'common, plentiful and typical of high meadows' in the Volga region (Rakov 2005-2007), however populations have been lost in some areas, for example from the parts of the Volga floodplain lost following completion of the 500 km-long Kuibyshev reservoir (Rakov 2005-2007). In Romania, four populations were recorded in 1978 (Schneider-Binder 1978). In 2006, a botanical survey came to the conclusion that the species as well as its natural habitat, the meadow-steppe had been lost; although both are protected by Romanian law, Badarau and Malos (2014) consider that there is a very high probability that both the species and its habitat at the known sites have been extirpated, whilst Ivanovici et al. (2010) consider that the species has been lost from Romania. In Bulgaria, a single population has been recently identified (Tzonev et al. 2007). In Hungary, of the 13 populations/locations known prior to the 21st century, all have been extirpated (B. Dénes pers. comm. 2014), and only two new new sites have been identified (in 2001-2 (Schneider-Binder 1978, Vidéki and Máté 2003, Tzonev et al. 2007, B. Dénes pers. comm. 2014).","The species grows in meso-hygrophile meadow-steppe grasslands developed on gleyic chernozems (Badarau and Malos 2014). Shipunov (1998) records the habitat of the species as saline meadows, steppe depressions, and rarely in forest clearings and edges.","The main threat of the species is habitat destruction through grazing, mowing, plowing and drainage (T.

It is planted along roadsides and in parks for urban landscaping and also occurs on coastal dunes (Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012). Poplars have dispersal distances of up to 16 km and seedling establishment relies on connection between patches of suitable habitat (Fussi et al. 2010). Its habitat is highly fragmented in some areas and its distribution range has been subject to long-term human interference; although this has caused range expansion, the origin of some populations is uncertain (Brundu et al. 2008). Many populations on Mediterranean islands are relicts of native flora which have spread through available habitats by vegetative propagation and human activities (Brundu et al. 2008). This tree can reproduce sexually, and also asexually through cuttings and root suckers. It is resistant to insect pests and fungal and bacterial pathogens, and tolerates diverse environmental stresses such as drought, wind, salinity and high temperatures (Brundu et al. 2008).

It occurs in ravines, often on vertical cliffs and is drought tolerant. Prolonged periods of summer drought may be a threat to both seedlings and reproducing individuals and therefore to long-term population persistence, particularly in its southernmost range. Estimates of sub-population sizes across the species range suggest that the species may be close to the population size threshold for a threatened category, and it is recommended that populations should be monitored for the impact of drier conditions arising from future climate change.",Decreasing,"The species is native to northern Spain and southern France (Castroviejo et al. 2001, Association Tela Botanica 2014), found in the Pyrenees and pre-Pyrenean hills and is in addition present in mountainous areas of southern Catalonia (Ports Massif and Montsià (Tarragona Province); L. Sáez pers. comm. 2014), with a fragmented distribution within this range (Picó and Riba 2002). Found from 390 m altitude (M. Riba pers. com. 2014), but more commonly 500 - 2,000 (2,300) m (Castroviejo et al. 2001). It is described as a preglacial relict species with a fragmented distribution in Mediterranean mountains.The species is one of the few gesneriads whose species are mostly pantropical, living in southern Europe and it is considered as a preglacial relict species, assuming that the species underwent glaciation episodes surviving in mountain valleys. Its main distribution area occurs in the Pyrenees although it also occurs in other calcareous massifs in west and central Catalonia (Picó and Riba 2002).","Research suggests it is rare within its distribution. Dubreuil et al. (2008) estimated the size of sub-population within eight main clusters across the species range; all populations were estimated to contain fewer than 500 individual flowering plants, with the majority containing between 100-500 individuals. It is not possible to estimate the total number of mature individuals from these data. Populations are isolated within mountain massifs and therefore the regional persistence of the species depends on the persistence of local populations. These population dynamics are of the remnant type and refer to persistent local populations that survive enough to bridge periods of unfavourable environmental conditions. Although recruitment may be sporadic its persistence is due to its high longevity. Its distribution is typically fragmented and sub-populations occur between 2-7 km apart. A census in 1997 reported around 13,330 individuals over five populations located at different exposures within the same ravine and no distinction was made between these populations. Seedlings with three leaves or less are considered to be non-reproductive as they have a survival probability of &lt;75% (Picó and Riba 2002). A six year study in Cerdanya (in the eastern Pyrenees) showed the main life-history features of the species are the great longevity of adult plants and the high mortality of seedlings due to high drought sensitivity and the availability of safe sites dominated by moss.Variation in climatic conditions at Cerdanya from year to year explained an important part of variations in population growth rates. Projections indicate that local populations tend to decline over time but with a long time to extinction, so the persistence of the species within Cerdanya is determined by the persistence of its remnant local populations (Picó and Riba 2002). Modelling of populations based on rainfall patterns suggest that, as a result of the species reduced rates of reproduction in dry conditions, southern populations might be declining, with only populations in the Pyrenees being stable. Estimates of the relationship between climate and the species' finite rate of increase (Lambda), as well as potential trends according to stochastic population growth taking into account long term rainfall patterns in different parts of the species range predict: 1. Based on estimates of finite rate of increase, most populations in most southernmost populations under extreme drought conditions (May – July Rainfall &lt;100 mm) might be declining; and 2. Stochastic simulations considering the past (50-75 years) temporal variability in rainfall patterns suggest that most populations except those located in the Pyrenees might be declining (M. Riba pers. com. 2014).","A Mediterranean sub-alpine long-lived iteroparous perennial herb which grows among shaded limestone crags and on siliceous substrates (L. Sáez pers. comm. 2014) in mountain areas in spruce, pine or deciduous forest and also in shady ravines on northern mountain slopes in the Pyrenees and other calcareous massifs in central and west Catalonia, northeastern Spain. Pyrenean populations are found at the bottom of shady ravines following the course of the streams. It is described as a species with an exceptional persistence despite drastic alterations in the environment. Flowers are produced from May to July and are hermaphroditic, self-compatible but not capable of autopollination and are mainly visited by bumblebees and syrphids. The plants are exposed to fluctuations in temperature, humidity and sun exposure on ravine slopes and the leaves are known to be able to endure complete desiccation. The roots can also be a stronghold even in shallow soils on moss covered vertical slopes (Castroviejo et al. 2001, Association Tela Botanica 2000-2012, Picó and Riba 2002).","There is no management by humans or induced perturbations such as fire in the Mediterranean habitats in which it occurs. The species is grazed by domestic cattle, however this is not currently a significant issue. Previous studies have shown that desiccation in spring reduces the reproductive output and growth of R. myconi plants as it causes flowers to abort early and fruit to wither and reduces the survival of seedlings. Prolonged periods of drought may threaten the persistence of this species or cause short term fluctuations if the adult population is threatened by other factors as they are not susceptible to drought. Over-collection for medicinal use has not been observed to be a threat.","It is recommended that populations should be monitored for the impact of drier conditions arising from future climate change.

It is considered to be Least Concern in Great Britain and Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002, Chefﬁngs and Farrell 2005) although is considered threatened in some countries, such as, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Bulgaria.Cultivation could reduce collection pressure on wild populations and several cultivation experiments have taken place. Cultivation has been found difficult outside mountain areas because of climatic differences. However, it has been successfully introduced as a commercial crop in the Rhodopes Mountains in Bulgaria, propagated by rhizome cuttings (Platikanova and Evstatieva 2008). Further research is needed since cultivation seems to be the only hope of producing raw material in sufficient quantities for the industrial scale production demanded (Galambosi 2006).","The leaves roots and stems can all be eaten. The leaves can eaten raw in salads or cooked and the stems cooked an eaten like asparagus. The root can be eaten raw or cooked and when dried has a rose scent. The species has been used in folk medicine for washing the hair since it gives a pleasant scent and was supposed to be good for the hair (Galambosi 2006). It has been used in traditional medicine as a tonic and to enhance endurance. Recent research has shown that it increases the body's resistance to stress by regulating hormonal responses. Its has a protective effect on neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. Studies have shown that use of this herb can increase brain serotonin by up to 30% (Plants for a Future 2014). There are other suggested medicinal uses such as in treatments for depression and for heart disorders such as irregular heartbeat and high cholesterol. Some consider it may be useful for treating a range of other disorders from cancer, tuberculosis, and diabetes to cold prevention, enhancing immunity and treating liver damage and even improving hearing (WebMD 2014). The chemical composition of the plant has been intensively investigated and many secondary metabolites have been identiﬁed within the chemical group of phenols. Cinnamic glycosides, such as rosin, rosavin, and rosarin, are considered the major group responsible for most of the pharmacological activities (Platikanova and Evstatieva 2008). Its medicinal use has increased worldwide (Galambosi 2006). It is cultivated as a garden plant. Also, as a response to over-collection and reduction of some populations in the wild, it is now grown as an economic crop and the acreage planted every year is expanding (Martin Bauer Group 2014).","Chadburn, H."

It can reproduce sexually by selfing and out crossed seeds or vegetatively through layering, which usually occurs downslope at 50 or 60 years of age. Heavy snow cover allows branches to root in the ground. It also produces many flowers and seeds (Castroviejo et al. 1993, Escaravage et al . 1998).","Grazing and pasture could cause a decline in this species, though in recent decades this pressure has been reduced in the northern Alps, favouring this species.

The species was widely used and introduced outside of its natural range, however current use and cultivation of the species is not certain (Hanelt et al . 2001) In the Alps and Central Europe, the species was cultivated and fermented to be used as pig fodder. In addition, the plants were also cultivated as a vegetable from 16th century to about 1800 (Hanelt et al. 2001).","Schweizer, F. & Hasinger, O."

The extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species exceeds the values needed for a threatened category under criterion B. It is suspected that the area of occupancy (AOO) also exceeds these values as it occurs over a range of altitudes and in several habitat types, for example, Western Pontic rhododendron-oriental beech forests, Illyrian and south Carpathian beech forests (EUNIS 2014). The population is inferred not to be small, for example, even in Slovakia, where this species is considered rare and endangered, in a study of eight populations ;the number of shoots at each site ranged from 126 to 595 (Halada and Erdekska 2005).Although it is under pressures of over-exploitation in parts of its range, if plant parts, stems and flowers, are collected this reduces reproductive capacity from seed but has less impact on vegetative reproduction. This may allow populations to persist but may ultimately affect their genetic make up and frequent cutting may reduce their viability. However, plants may also be uprooted.There are few quantitative data relating to declines. One study found that it had some resistance to disturbance and, together with vegetative reproduction, this allowed the populations, surveyed between 1987 and 1998 in a 100 m2 permanent plot, to remain stable (Halada and Erdekska 2005). From this it is inferred that populations overall may not have declined sufficiently to trigger a threatened category under criterion A. It is assessed on these inferences as Least Concern. However, this appears not to be a common plant in some areas and it is considered threatened in many countries within its range.

It is likely that the population has declined due to collection from the wild, particularly in Greece and possibly also Albania, though it is cultivated in Albania which mitigates collection pressure on wild populations.Based on the available information, it is listed as Least Concern in both regional Europe and the EU 27 in view of its wide distribution and presumed large overall population, such that the risk of the species going completely extinct in Europe is quite low. However, more information on the current population size, trend and the overall rate of decline is needed to review whether it would qualify for threatened under Criterion A; it may be threatened or near threatened, particularly in the EU 27 where its status is heavily dependent on population trends in Greece.",Unknown,"Salvia fruticosa is native to the central and eastern Mediterranean region and North Africa (RBG Kew 2010, Gonaid et al. 2012). In Greece, it occurs in almost all littoral areas of the mainland, as well as on the Ionian and Aegean Islands, forming extended populations in the Mediterranean ecosystems. In Crete it has a continuous distribution all over the island and has been found at altitudes between sea level and 900 metres (Karousou and Kokkini 1997). The extent of occurrence (EOO) in Crete alone is approximately 5,000 to 7,000 km². Outside of regional Europe, it is native to Israel, Libya, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey in Asia, and has been introduced to Algeria and Morocco (RBG Kew 2010).","The number of individuals is unknown. This species is widespread and abundant in parts of its range, but is under high collection pressure and may be declining. The subpopulation in Greece was recorded over 15 scattered localities (Pitarokili et al. 2003). On Crete it is widespread, dominating particularly in central Crete, the Lasithi area and the Sitia peninsula, though in west Crete it is less common and coexists with, or is replaced by, the Greek endemic Salvia pomifera L. subsp. pomifera (Karousou and Kokkini 1997). At least three genetically variable populations have been found on the island of Crete (Skoula et al. 1999). In Turkey, it is widespread and common in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, mostly restricted to western Anatolia though it has also been recorded from a few localities at the coastal edge of the Marmara region; an estimated 5-10 % of the global population is found in western Anatolia (Celep et al. 2010, Kahraman et al. 2011).

It is also used in traditional medicine as the leaves are antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, carminative, depurative, expectorant, febrifuge, stimulant, tonic and vasodilator (Gonaid et al. 2012). The essential oil has antifungal and antioxidant properties. The extracts of the aerial parts could be used as a natural anthelmintic and slug control agent (Pitarokili et al. 2003, Papageorgiou et al. 2008). It is an important herb used predominantly in the Mediterranean region as a spice, though it is also used in the rest of the world as a substitute to Salvia officinalis and for oil production. The main supplies are from Turkey, Greece, Albania, where plants are collected from wild populations once a year between the flowering and seed stages, though it is also cultivated (Putievsky et al. 1986). In Greece, it is collected from almost the entire mainland and islands for limited trade by local people for use as a condiment and in decoctions; it is not thought to be cultivated in Greece (European Herb Growers Association 2010). Albania is Europe's leading sage producer ( Salvia officinalis and Salvia fruticosa ), exporting over 1000 tonnes annually with a market value of US$ 2.5 million (in 2000); however, since the early 1990s, Albania's export figures have fallen dramatically (from about US$ 30 million to US$ 10-12 million in the late 1990s) and the production of essential oil has declined from 60-100 to 10-20 tonnes per annum (Kathe et al . 2003).

The fresh leaves can be used to make tea for relief of cold, flu and sore throats. A decoction with wine can be gargled for relief of toothache and a mixture with rosemary is reputed to maintain, strengthen and stimulate the growth of brunette hair (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003). The leaves are well known for their anti-oxidative, anti-bacterial, fungistatic, virustatic, astringent, eupeptic and anti-hydrotic properties. The antimicrobial properties of the tannins have astringent properties and are an active ingredient of dental-care herbal medicinal preparations. The extracts and essential oil have hypotensive properties, central nervous system-depressant actions and antispasmodic activity (Baricevic et al. 2001). Herbal preparations consist of comminuted herbal substance, dry or liquid extract, tincture, herbal tea and liquid or semi-solid preparations for oromucosal use. The essential oil has a very variable composition depending on the source and harvest time but consists of thujone, cineol, camphor and the leaves tannins, diterpene bitter principles, triterpenes, steroids, flavones, and flavonoid glycosides (European Medicine Agency 2009a,b). The essential oil from the plant is used in small doses to remove mucous from the respiratory organs and mixed in embrocations for treating rheumatism and used internally in the treatment of excessive lactation, night sweats, excessive salivation (as in Parkinson's disease), profuse perspiration (as in TB), anxiety, depression, female sterility and menopausal problems. Sage is furthermore used commercially to flavour baked goods, ice cream, and sweets (Plants for a Future 2012). Natural populations in Spain are stable and weakly exploited, scarcely collected; probably not harvested for their essential oils for more than 20 years, when rudimentary stills were used directly in the field.

Examples include Pirin National Park in Bulgaria and Apuseni National Park in Romania (where extensive stands of undisturbed forest are protected; Feurdean and Willis 2008). It is also listed in 135 Natura 2000 sites (EUNIS 2014). Guidelines have also been produced to aid forest managers to encourage fir regeneration in managed forests and to control the type of replanting material used in those areas (Wolf 2003). It is conserved ex situ in 125 botanic gardens worldwide (BCGI 2013). It is not known whether any seeds are stored in seed banks, although their suitability is cited (Wolf 2003).","This is an important timber tree in western and central Europe, where most forests are semi-natural and managed with a view to encourage fir regeneration and growth at the expense of competitors. It is not very successful as a plantation forestry tree outside its natural areas of occurrence; one cause of this may be damage done by insect pests, which may be more prolific in monocultures and in areas with mild winters such as in the British Isles. Its most famous use in the past was for the masts of seventeenth century ships. Most of its wood today is used for plywood and veneer as it is evenly grained, light, and easily worked. Minor uses are for soundboards in musical instruments, boxes, wood carving, and sometimes for joinery. The buds, bark and leaves are all believed to have medicinal properties, for example, antiseptic, antibiotic, diuretic and balsamic. Distillation of the leaf essential oils has in the past been used to produce remedies for sprains and bruises and the leaves and resin are ingredients for remedies for coughs and colds. The resin can be added to bathes to soothe rheumatic pains and neuralgia. In Britain it was used as a Christmas tree in the nineteenth century when Prince Albert popularized the tradition; its use has declined since in favour of the more quickly and cheaply produced Norway Spruce. In horticulture White Fir is uncommon and mostly restricted to arboreta; a number of cultivars are known but few are common in the trade. The bark can be ground and used to thicken soups and in bread making as a subsistence food (Wolf 2003, PFAF 2014).","Farjon, A."

It has been significantly damaged by the leaf miner moth Cameraria ohridella across its entire native and introduced range; the extent of decline caused by infestation is thought to be insignificant, however, compared to the multiple threats the Pindus Mountain mixed forest ecoregion is facing. The species is threatened or likely to be extinct across most of its native range: it is Endangered in Bulgaria (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Environment and Water 2011), where it remains in two locations, and in Greece, where the declining population is estimated at only 259-407 trees; it is probably Extinct in Albania. The status of the population in Macedonia is unknown, but given the small range in the country, it is likely to be small.The species occurs in protected areas in Greece and Bulgaria, including national parks/reserves and Natura 2000 sites, although mining, deforestation, tourism development and other threats still impact some national parks. Given the widespread and varied threats across its native range, the population is almost certainly suffering a continuing decline, though the overall decline has not been quantified. Although the total population size across its native range has not been estimated, it is unlikely to consist of more than 10,000 mature individuals and may even be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. Based on the subpopulation structure in Greece and the ongoing threats across its range, all wild subpopulations are likely smaller than 1,000 individuals. At the European level, Aesculus hippocastanum is therefore assessed as Vulnerable C2a(i). It also qualifies for Vulnerable C2a(i) in its EU 27 range (Bulgaria and Greece), where the majority of the native population is found. There is likely to be immigration of propagules into its native range as it has been introduced throughout Europe, so the original category is downlisted to Near Threatened in both Europe and the EU 27.Recommended conservation measures include controlling the Cameraria ochridella leaf miner, enforcement of protection regimes in nature reserves, regulating human impacts on its habitats, and ex situ cultivation using genetic material from remaining natural populations. Research is needed on the genetic similarity between native and introduced subpopulations, to determine if introduced subpopulations likely to be the source of propagules may indeed help augment declining native populations.",Decreasing,"Horse Chestnut ( Aesculus hippocastanum ) is native to Greece and the central Balkan Peninsula and has been introduced throughout Europe and North America.

This species shows remarkable habitat adaptability, as it occurs in a wide range of altitudes from 228 m to 1,485 m a.s.l. (Avtzis et al. 2007).","Horse Chestnut trees have suffered from severe defoliation by alien invasive species of leaf miner moth, Cameraria ohridella , which impairs the growth and survival of trees by reducing the weight of seeds; this may endanger the long term persistence of the species within its native range and throughout Europe. The leaf miner infestation was first observed in the late 1970s in Macedonia. Since 2002 it has been reported in the United Kingdom, Spain, Albania, Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and western Russia (Thalmann et al . 2003, Forestry Commission 2013). In Bulgaria, Horse Chestnut has a restricted distribution and is threatened by local tourism and pollution, wood extraction and forest fires (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences & Ministry of Environment and Water 2011). In recent years, Greece has been subject to increased deforestation and forest fires, which could occur within protected areas; rapid changes in the landscape through overgrazing, firewood collection and agriculture are accelerated with population growth, socio-economic and political instability, leading to deforestation and soil erosion. However, the Pindus mountain ranges still host significant old-growth forest stands, mainly related to inaccessible high mountain slopes and canyons. Human impact is high in this ecoregion, particularly in Albania where illegal logging has destroyed extensive forest areas, including certain National Parks in Albania. Mountain tourism, ski facilities and road construction are strongly degrading huge mountain forest ecosystems due to soil erosion and clear cutting operations, which have provoked significant landslides and the collapse of large mountain slopes. Mining, particularly for bauxite in Iti National Park, is a direct and indirect threat. Related activities threaten certain protected areas and their endangered habitats and species. Overgrazing and over-collection of plants continue to threaten the region's ecosystems (WWF 2013).","This species is listed as Endangered [EN B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii)] in Bulgaria, where it is located within a Natura 2000 site, part of the population is within the Dervisha Managed Nature Reserve, and it is a protected species under the Biodiversity Act (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences & Ministry of Environment and Water 2011). The data derived from the survey in Greece by Avtzis et al. (2007) shows a natural population of 259-407+ trees, which is presumed to be suffering an ongoing declining given current threats. This species can therefore be classified as Endangered C2a(i) in Greece. This species' mixed forest habitat is found within National Parks in Greece, where under half the natural population is included in reserves and 18 of 37 locations are within the boundaries of the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, managed by the Greek Forest Service and Ministry of the Environment. Protection and conservation of the southern populations should be a primary concern for conservation.   The Pindus Mountains Mixed Forest ecoregion status is classified as Critical/Endangered (WWF 2013), and the population in Albania is probably Extinct (Xhuveli et al. 1996). It is classified as Least Concern in Norway (Artsdatabanken 2010) and Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002), though those populations are introduced. Recommended conservation measures include controlling the Cameraria ochridella leaf miner, enforcement of protection regimes in nature reserves, regulating human impacts on its habitats, and ex situ cultivation using genetic material from remaining natural populations. Research is needed on the genetic similarity between native and introduced subpopulations, to determine if introduced subpopulations likely to be the source of propagules may indeed help augment declining native populations.  ",This tree is used in homeopathic medicine as a tincture (abc Homeopathy 2001-2009). The seeds (called 'conkers') are popular in children's games and the tree is commonly planted for ornamental and landscape features in parks and urban areas. It is of economic importance for wood production and medicinally the major active substance Aescin extracted from the seeds is used for upset stomachs (Avtzis et al. 2007). The conker is processed by the pharmaceutical industry to produce treatments for vascular problems such as varicose veins and haemorrhoids. The unprocessed seeds are poisonous and a decoction of the bark and leaves is used in Albanian folk medicine to treat circulatory problems (Gloyer 2012).,"Khela, S."

The fresh or dried leaves, flowers and stems can be used to make tea and the seeds are edible however large quantities can cause digestive problems and constipations due to the tannins. It has been popular as a herbal remedy for gentle cleansing of the digestive tract and an infusion has been reputed to be a good treatment for jaundice and liver problems as well as a strong decoction for treating skin problems, wounds and haemorrhoids. This herbal remedy has been approved by the German Commission E Monographs for treating diarrhoea, and inflammation of the mouth, skin and pharynx.

It is under intense collection pressure from the wild, with increasing demand for its medicinal value. The mass collection of generative shoots during the flowering phase combined with low germination of seeds has resulted in a significant population declines, at least in parts of its range, as the plant has been exploited for its herbal properties. It is not known to be extensively cultivated and although it occurs in protected areas and is a protected species in some countries, the degree of enforcement is unknown and collection is ongoing. Anthropogenic activities such as land use changes, trampling, ploughing, creation of forest trails, and grazing by cattle are additional threats.Populations have been declining for several decades, particularly in Bulgaria (where the most population information is available), though the decline has not been quantified. Although conservation measures have been put in place in the past ten years, whether these have been effective is unknown; they have not been so in the past. The species is threatened in half of its countries of occurrence and its population appears to be quite small (2,500 mature individuals in Bulgaria and 250 in Serbia), though population data are absent from the centre of its range in Albania, Macedonia and Greece, where populations might be larger (but demand is expected to remain high). Given the species' threatened status across much of its range, and considering the uncertainty in the population sizes and degree of decline, it is listed as Near Threatened approaching criteria A2cde.Within the EU 27, it is present only in Bulgaria and Greece and is threatened in both countries. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 20,000-30,000 km². It is severely fragmented and suffering a continuing decline in both the quality of habitat and number of mature individuals. As the most intense collection pressure is in Bulgaria and Greece, and presuming population declines over the past 10-15 years have followed the same pattern as over the past few decades, it is suspected to have declined by at least 20% across its EU 27 range, and possibly 30% or more. It is therefore listed as Near Threatened approaching criteria A2cde and B1ab(iii,v).Close monitoring and protection of the small remaining fragmented population is required.",Decreasing,"Sideritis scardica is endemic to the central part of the Balkan Peninsula (RBG Kew 2012). Its distribution is not continuous, but rather fragmented between mountain ranges at high elevations. In Macedonia, it is widespread in the central and western mountains. In Albania, it is limited to the mountains in the southwest, where it is known from Steblevë Markgraf (Dibëra District) at 1500 m (Janeska et al. 2007, Petreska et al. 2010, L. Shuka pers. comm. 2013). In Bulgaria it is only known from nine localities in the Slavyanka Mountains, Pirin Mountains and Rhodopi Mountains at elevations between 1,000 to 2,200 metres (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). It is distributed mainly in mountainous areas of eastern-central, north-central and north-eastern Greece, between 1,600 and 2,300 m asl ( Strid and Tan 1991, National Technical University of Athens 2011). It has been recorded from European Turkey, at 800 m asl (Güner et al. 2000). The exact distribution in Serbia is unknown, but likely to be restricted to the mountains at high elevations. The extent of occurrence (EOO) across Europe, as measured by the minimum convex hull, is estimated to be around 86,000 km²; the calculated area of suitable habitat within its European range is roughly estimated to be 9,600 km². Within the EU 27, the EOO is estimated to be around 20,000-30,000 km², based on known locality data in Bulgaria and presence in Natura 2000 sites in Greece ( Bulgarian Academy of Sciences & Ministry of Environment and Water 2011, National Technical University of Athens 2011).","The total population size is unknown. Collection of this species for its healing properties has led to a decrease in the size of populations (Aneva et al. 2013). In some areas, the plant was so abundant in the 1950s and 1960s that collection of flower-bearing stalks took place by mowing; today, the species has declined drastically in parts of its range (e.g. Dobrostan, where only a few specimens remained in 1999; Yordanova and Apostolova 2000). This is unsurprising, considering the high proportion of reproductive shoots collected during the flowering season, which, along with low germination of seeds, has led to a decline in generative reproduction in at least parts of its range (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000). In Bulgaria, there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, with fewer than 250 in each of the fragmented subpopulations, and the population is declining (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). Yordanova and Apostolova (2000) found that populations maintained highest density on rocky terrains, most likely because such terrains are least accessible to anthropogenic interference and also because the extreme conditions in such habitats reduce competition. They also found limited formation of generative shoots, indicating poor reproductive capacity of the population in general. No population information is available from Macedonia, though the plant is widespread (Janeska et al. 2007). In Serbia , the subpopulation has over 250 individuals (Baričevič et al. 2004), however, its presence is not verified in any literature. The number of individuals in Greece and Albania are unknown. It is not a rare species in Greece, though Sideritis species are often over-collected for their use in the preparation of mountain tea; the species is assumed to be declining due to over-collection for commercial demand and possibly habitat decline (I. Bazos pers. comm. 2013). In Greece it is cross pollinated and therefore each colony at different sites is a different open-pollinated subpopulation, which is increasing the natural hybridization of this species (Lipman 2009).","A short-lived herbaceous perennial which reproduces by seed, this plant is found in open, dry, grassy and stony meadows and rocky places on limestone shallow or eroded soils; it grows in the subalpine and alpine vegetation belts with other high mountain plants (Strid and Tan 1991, Petrova and Vladimirov 2009, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences & Ministry of Environment and Water 2011). It occurs on slopes predominantly with southern exposure and an incline of 5-30 degrees for maximum insolation, higher temperatures and dry conditions. It is capable of associating with different plant species provided there is little competition between them, and was found to be particularly associated with habitat dominated by Juniperus communis , probably because it found shelter from trampling and collecting under the bushes, as increased density of Juniper during natural succession would gradually push S. scardica out of the habitat (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000).","The principle threat to this species is intensive collection for trade as a medicinal plant. It is collected from natural populations found in the mountains, particularly in Greece and Bulgaria where it has become threatened due to increased demand. On Mount Olympus, a major tourist attraction, it grows wild but colonies are more susceptible as they can be observed and collected easily (Lipman 2009). Collection pressure could cause complete extinction of the species in Bulgaria (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). The legal protection status conferred in Bulgaria in 1989 had little or no effect, as the plant is still collected on a mass scale throughout the country, except where protection is enforced by authorities (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000). Extensive collection of generative shoots before seed production has reduced the reproductive output (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000). Anthropogenic activities such as trampling and collecting also impact the species, as evidenced by the higher density of plants found in close proximity to Juniperus communis , which offers some protection (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000). There is also grazing pressure from cattle and further pressure of habitat loss from humans through land use changes, ploughing and creation of forest trails (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000, National Technical University of Athens 2011). ","In Bulgaria, Sideritis scardica is listed as Endangered B1ab(ii,iii,v)+2ab(ii,iii,iv); C2a(i) (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). Part of the population is protected within the Alibotush Strict Nature Reserve, Pirin National Park, and Trigradsko Zdrelo Protected Site in the Rhodopi Mountains, where the localities are within Natura 2000 sites; it is also found within the Slavyanka Reserve. The species is included on the list of medicinal plants under special regime for conservation and use in Bulgaria, and has been successfully propagated for inclusion in ex situ collection of rare and endemic plants from the Pirin Mountains (Kozuharova 2009). In Bulgaria, gathering for trade is prohibited under special protection and use Ordinance no. RD-71/2007 (Evstatieva et al. 2007). The harvesting of plant material from the natural populations of is prohibited, and material for the pharmaceutical industry and phytotherapy for medicine can only be obtained by cultivation through conventional and biotechnological methods, which will help ensure the sustainable use and conservation of the species (Vitkova et al. 2011). In Macedonia, the Ministry of the Environment has regulated its export due to unregulated demand and sale of this species. This species is listed as Critically Endangered in Serbia; t here is one domestic/improved cultivar in F.R. Yugoslavia (Baričevič et al. 2004). It is described as threatened in Greece (Lipman 2009), and is provisionally listed as threatened in Albania (L. Shuka pers. comm. 2013). It has been identified as a target species for the SEEDNet Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Working Group (Lipman 2009). Conservation priorities for the protection and preservation of this species include protection under national legislation (e.g. the Biodiversity Act in Bulgaria), ex situ conservation by preserving their seeds and germplasm, and increasing the area in cultivation to cover the increasing demands from consumers (Lipman 2009, Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). Research is needed to quantify the harvest across its range and measure the extent of declines, particularly in Albania and Turkey where there is no population information available. Populations should be monitored to ensure collection from the wild is sustainable and that existing conservation actions are effective; protection of the plant from overcollection has been achieved in specific sites through active monitoring and protection (e.g. Mougla Forestry Range in Moursalitza Ridge, Bulgaria; Yordanova and Apostolova 2000)."," Sideritis scardica has historically been a valuable medicinal plant. The name 'Sideritis' derives from the Greek word “sideros” meaning iron; in the ancient past, Sideritis was a generic reference for plants used to heal wounds caused by iron weapons during battles (Aneva et al. 2013). Very popular throughout its range, the plant is used as a herb either for the preparation of tisane, using stems, leaves and flowers, or for its aromatic properties in local cuisines. It has traditionally been used to aid digestion, strengthen the immune system, suppress viral infections, and to treat allergies and shortness of breath, sinus congestion, pain and mild anxiety. In Bulgaria, it is cultivated on approximately 0.5 ha (Petrova and Vladimirov 2009). The essential oil from the aerial parts varies in composition between the Macedonian and Bulgarian subpopulations, but is used to cure bronchitis and bronchial asthma, common cold and lung emphysema (Kostadinova et al . 2007, Knorle 2012). It is also commonly used to make 'mountain tea', as with other Sideritis species, and is rich in flavanoids, terpenes and essential oils, iridoids, coumarins, lignans and sterols (Mursalski Tea 2013, Yankova-Tsvetkova et al . 2013). There is considerable interest in this species as a medicinal plant; despite it being protected it is subject to intensive exploitation due to its anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity (Yordanova and Apostolova 2000, Petreska et al . 2010). In Serbia, it is a minor and underutilized crop with only one or two cultivars (FAO n.d.).","Khela, S."

The species is listed as threatened in the Netherlands and Belgium, and Near Threatened in Finland and Germany. This plant is of less medicinal value than Thymus vulgaris but is still one of the most collected and harvested species from the wild in eastern European countries such as Albania and Ukraine. Its status in these countries is unknown but the population may be declining due to overcollection, though it is cultivated in Albania.Up-to-date harvest information is required for further evaluation of the wild population remaining in Eastern Europe. In west and central Europe, the population is declining in some regions due to a decline in the area and quality of its habitat, through changes in management and land use. These declines have not been quantified, and the species remains widespread and abundant across most of Europe and the EU 27. Its widespread cultivation is also likely to mitigate the demand on wild populations. This plant is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a threatened category, and is therefore listed as Least Concern.Research and monitoring of the population trend across Europe is recommended to determine the extent of declines and ensure collection is sustainable.

In the Ukraine there are significant resources but it has a limited distribution (Minarchenko 2011). This species is often confused with other Thymus species, and is therefore overlooked or misidentified (G. Király pers. comm. 2013).","Breckland Thyme is a small perennial herb or small shrub found in lowland dry sandy heaths, chalk grasslands and inland dunes in areas grazed by rabbits or sheep (Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012).

In Italy it is found in arid pastures in the Alps and Appennines up to 2,200 metres elevation, and in Romania it is found in hill and montane vegetation. The fruit is a nutlet (Lipman 2009). It is an important food plant for many insects, which require large viable populations. Indeed, it is the only food plant for several threatened insect species (Rassi et al. 2010).","The distribution of Thymus serpyllum is dependent on human activities, both for dispersal and for the maintenance of established populations. Given its association with grazed habitats, long, continuous management of sustainable grazing practices is important for the maintenance of these populations (Eriksson 1998). In the United Kingdom, sites where the species was known were lost in the past as heathland was ploughed for forestry and cultivation; the decline in rabbit and sheep populations further reduced areas of short, open turf. However, the recovery of rabbit populations and increase in sheep grazing has ensured the maintenance of suitable conditions at its remaining sites (Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012). The species is likely declining in other parts of Europe where traditional grazing practices are being abandoned.

Wild thyme growing naturally in Estonia has a low quality of the drugs of interest. In Estonia it is cultivated and utilised from the wild (Paaver et al . 2008). Phenolic compounds (thymol and carvacol), a characteristic feature of the Serpyllum species growing in the Northern European countries, have not been detected in T. serpyllum . It has lower essential oil content than common thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ) and is used mostly for preparing herbal baths and pillows and the essential oil to make toothpastes, mouthwash and other toiletries. Since 2003, the flowering aerial parts have been included in the European Pharmacopeia for use as an antiseptic, expectorant and antispasmodic for treatment of whooping cough, bronchitis and gastrointestinal disorders. The plant has been in cultivation for centuries, because it is important in pharmacology and decorative horticulture. Wild thyme is an important nectar source plant for honeybees. In Latvia there are 20 accessions, and 10 ex situ accessions in Poland (Loziene et al . 1998, Raal et al. 2004, Lipman 2009).

In Poland, lime regeneration is successful where it regenerates freely in groups in Białowieża Forest; vegetative reproduction is very important for populations growing on the border of natural range. Sprouting is known to prolong the life of damaged trees. It is a co-dominant tree in mixed stands and pure stands can be found in the eastern part of Europe (i.e. lime or lime-oak forests in Russia). It is most abundant from north-east France through central Germany and Poland to central Russia and north Ukraine. It is common in the Swiss plain and the lowland parts of Austria, Czech Republic and western Hungary, occurring sparsely in Alpine valleys and is absent in the dry parts of the Hungarian plain. In Italy and Greece pure stands are rare. Flowering and seed production of stand trees begins at the age of about 25-30 years, but trees originating from sprouts blossom 10-15 years earlier.

Inbreeding is expected to have an impact on its population (Honnay et al. 2004).","This tall deciduous tree can live up to 500 years and is found in ancient or old mixed deciduous woodland, growing in calcareous soil as a large tree or coppice stool. It is found in upland areas and also grows on cliff ledges as well as being planted in urban areas (Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora 2012). The EUNIS habitat classification is Thermophilous Alpine and peri-Alpine mixed [Tilia] forests (European Environment Agency 2010). This species flowers at the age of 30 and maturation of seed and germ is slow; normally seeds germinate two years from harvest with seeds from older trees having a higher germination rate. It can easily reproduce vegetatively through cuttings and root layers and cuttings can be propagated from old trees.","This species is sensitive to climatic conditions and is not tolerant of frost or drought. In the past, it was threatened by deforestation and invasion by Beech. The distribution has declined over the last 2000 years due to farming expansion and in northern Europe it has declined due to low seed fertility. Inbreeding caused by the extensive fragmentation and destruction of biotopes is expected to have an impact on both Tilia cordata and T. platyphyllos (Jensen 2003). Intensive pruning for lime flowers and heavy livestock grazing are also significant threats (Radaglou et al. 2008).","Large-leaved Lime is classified as Least Concern in Belgium (Van Landuyt et al . 2006), Denmark (NERI 2007), Germany (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2012), Luxembourg (Colling 2005), Switzerland (Moser et al . 2002) and the United Kingdom (Chef fings and Farrell 2005). It is Critically Endangered (CR D) in Norway (Artsdatabanken 2010) and Sweden (CR D) ( Gärdenfors 2010), and Endangered in Albania (FAO 2006). Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines are listed in the EU Habitats Directive Annex I and Mixed ravine and slope forests in Council of Europe Bern Convention Res. No. 4 1996 (European Environment Agency 2010). In Croatia, an annual quota of 1000 kg was set up in 2001 by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Physical Planning, Nature Protection Division (Kathe et al . 2003). Conservation of older or ancient woodlands is necessary. More information is required on rarity and continued declines, particularly since it is so long-lived and slow declines over long time periods may have substantial impacts on the population.","Tilia flos (lime flower) consists of the whole dried inflorescence of Tilia cordata Miller, of Tilia platyphyllos Scop., of Tilia x vulgaris Heyne or a mixture of these as stated in the European Pharmacopoeia 2008. It is used in herbal preparations as a comminuted herbal substance, liquid extract or tincture. The tannin or mucilage content in the flowers produce more flavourable teas and extracts. This species is cultivated in Europe and North America, while the material of commerce originates mainly from Balkan countries (e.g. Bulgaria, Romania, former Yugoslavia, Turkey) and in part from China. In Bulgaria, an average of 1,246,223 kg of Flos Tiliae is used for export, originating from very good natural stocks or cultivation (Evstatieva et al . 2007). Its use is authorized and regulated in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany (Commission E monographs), Hungary (VIth Hungarian Pharmacopoeia), Lithuania and Poland (Polish Pharmacopoeia of 1970) for treatment of colds and coughs, as it has sedative, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, hypotensive, emollient, diuretic and mild astringent properties. Lime flower is listed by the Council of Europe as a natural source of food flavouring to be added in small quantities (European Medicines Agency 2012a). It can easily reproduce vegetatively through cuttings and root layers and cuttings can be propagated from old trees. Tilia wood is used for carving (Jensen 2003). In Montenegro, where it is one of the most exploited species, it is not protected and free for gathering and trade under Official Gazette SRCG No 27/02. There is sufficient source of raw material for commercial interest. It is cultivated in Slovakia where research is carried out for breeding and seed improvement (Baričevič et al . 2004, Lipman 2009). It is exported from the former Yugoslavia destined for markets in Germany, France, Austria, Italy and the USA (Kathe et al. 2003).","Chadburn, H."

It is rare in Greece and the pure Silver Lime wood stands in Bulgaria are classified as Endangered, however, individuals may occur throughout the country.The leaves and flowers are used for medicinal purposes and the species has declined due to collection from the wild, harvesting for wood, competition from other broadleaved trees (such as Beech) in coppiced forests and heavy livestock grazing. It is still described as a dominant tree, though it is cultivated and may be difficult to determine which parts of the population are wild.It is classified as Least Concern given its widespread distribution, large overall population, invasive nature in parts of its range, and because the existing threats are unlikely to cause the species’ populations to severely decline in the near future.",Unknown,"Tilia tomentosa is native to Southeastern Europe and Southwestern Asia, and is a dominant species of mixed deciduous forests in the Balkans. In Hungary, it is widespread in the hilly area south of Lake Balaton (Somogyi-dombság, Mecsek), and is also present in the eastern region bordering to Romania (G. Király pers. comm. 2013). In Romania, it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres asl, the optimum elevation being 150-450 metres asl. In Bulgaria it is found in the north east in flat hills and foothills of the Mizian zone, where it occurs over an area of 17,273.1 ha (172.73 km²), of which 13.3% are pure stands. According to Assyov and Petrova (2006), it occurs throughout the entire country. It occurs in the Ukraine near Uzgorod (G. Király pers. comm. 2013).

(European Environment Agency 2010, Radoglou et al . 2008). A ccording to Franjić and Škvorc (2010), i n Croatia it is most widespread on Bilogora in northern Croatia, which supposedly got its name because of the white leaves of Tilia tometosa (Bilo - white, gora – mountain), but most recorded localities of this species in Croatia are on Moslavačka gora, Dilj gora and Spačva (Nikolić 2011).","There is no information on the population size, and the overall population trend is unknown; the species faces several threats and is declining in some parts of its range, but is invasive in other parts of its range. In former times lime trees were more abundant in the Greek mountains but now they are scattered and rare.","Silver Lime is a fast-growing tall deciduous tree found in Silver Lime woods in south Romania, north Bulgaria and Serbia. Soil moisture is a limiting factor which restricts its natural occurrence. At ages of over 50-60 years it dominates over steep and flat terrain in Bulgaria. In Greece it is found in vegetation zones of deciduous broadleaves in mixture with beech, oak, ash, and maple; pure stands are very rare. It is also found in mixed stands of forest steppe (Radoglou et al. 2008). In Croatia, it grows in the community Carpino betuli-Quercetum roboris , which extends on the area of ca. 110,000 ha in Croatia, with largest stands in the area of Spačva and along river Sava and its tributaries. This species is an important, sometimes dominant or co-dominant, species within the tree and shrub layer of several plant communities in Southeastern Europe, though this dominance may in some cases result from a large anthropogenic influence (Dinic et al. 1999, Petrescu 2007, Vukelić et al. 2012). This species can be invasive, often becoming dominant in beech and other hardwood forests and causing forestry problems in some regions of the northern Balkans (G. Király pers. comm. 2013).","Silver Lime is collected from the wild across most of its range for its medicinal properties and wood. In Greece, pure stands are rare and the population continues to decrease due to competition with other broadleaved species in coppice forests, intensive pruning for lime flowers and heavy livestock grazing ( Radoglou et al. 2008). Large scale cuttings and over exploitation of the wood are also threats ( Bulgarian Academy of Sciences & Ministry of Environment and Water 2011).","In Bulgaria, Silver Lime woods are classified as Endangered (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Environment and Water 2011). This species is only found in one Natura 2000 site, in Romania (European Environment Agency 2010). In Croatia, it was not listed in the Ordinance on Proclamation of Wild Taxa as Protected and Strictly Protected (Official Gazette 99/09), which means that it is neither protected nor strictly protected (I. Boršić pers. comm.). The species would benefit from protection of its habitats where it is declining, and from harvest management should this prove to be unsustainable.","This tree species is utilised for its wood as sawlogs and veneer logs (Radoglou et al. 2008). Tilia tomentosae flos (Silver Lime flower) consists of the whole dried inflorescence of Tilia tomentosa Moench, gathered during the flowering season. No products containing silver lime flowers are available in the Member States of the European Union, except Herbal Tea in Czech Republic. Traditionally, lime flowers were added to baths to quell hysteria and steeped as a tea to relieve anxiety-related indigestion, heart palpitation and vomiting (European Medicines Agency 2012). In Turkey, the leaves are used in treatment of common cold and bronchitis (Toker et al. 2004). It is harvested from the wild in eastern Bosnia with an estimated annual quantity of 22 tonnes of flowers collected; 5% of this goes to local market, 10% to the national market and 85% to the international market at a price of 7.50 KM / 3.75 Euro per kg dried flowers, though export rates may have recently increased due to increasing demand. It was frequently collected from the Kozara National Park. It is one of the top most harvested species from the wild in Bulgaria, with an estimated 160 tonnes of flowers collected; between 1992-1995 it was one of the most important medicinal and aromatic plants exported (including other Tilia spp). In Romania, a 2001 study found 75 tonnes of flowers were collected with 20% for sale on local market, 20% national market and 60% international market; total revenue from trade in 2001 was $240,000 from these 75 tonnes (Kathe et al. 2003). It is not often collected in Hungary as it has only moderate medicinal value; rather, other Tilia species ( T. cordata and T. platyphyllos ) are collected (G. Király pers. comm. 2013).

PLANTAE,TRACHEOPHYTA,MAGNOLIOPSIDA,MYRTALES,TRAPACEAE,Trapa,natans,,"The taxonomy of the genus Trapa appears to be complex, with only this species recognised throughout much of Europe, but up to 15 species recognised in the east. The distinguishing character for the different subordinate taxa appear to be useful, but no information on the degree to which they have been tested or any details of molecular studies could be found. T. natans is treated here as one of 15 taxa of the genus occurring in Europe. The distribution of T. natans sensu stricto is obscured by variation in the degree to which other taxa are recognised. It is likely that the information employed here will include information on other taxa and will therefore present a more positive idea of the status of the species than is actually the case. In typical populations of this species (var. natans ), the crown of the fruit is 4-5 mm wide while the distance between the base of the fruit and the base of the lower cornicles is 6.5-10.0 mm. In var. borysthenica (V. Vassil.) Tzvel., the crown of the fruit is 5-6(7) mm wide and the distance between the base of the fruit and the base of the lower cornicles is 4.0-6.5 mm (which could be the result of ancient hybridisation with T. sibirica ). The variety with almost cylindrical tubercles between the bases of the apical and lower cornicles (such tubercles in all four), which may also be considered a result of abnormal development of fruit, is so far known only from the Berezine River and from the Para River in the Oka Basin (Tzvelev 2006).

The rate of decline within the last three generations is not known neither are the causes of the decline. It is suspected that the decline has been ongoing since 900 BC due to a constant cooling of the climate, but in this case the current increase in mean temperatures could benefit this species. It is difficult to assess it under Criterion A but the species is clearly under threat and is therefore precautionary assessed as Near Threatened.",Decreasing,"Trapa natans has been reported from most of Europe north into southern Sweden and east into European Russia. Outside Europe, it occurs east throughout most of Asia into China, the Philippines and Malaysia. It has apparently been introduced into Australia and North America where it is now widespread and may be invasive. It is difficult to interpret information on the distribution of this species with any confidence due to taxonomic confusion. Thus, for example, according to (Stevanović 1999) the only Trapa species occurring in Serbia was T. annosa , but T. natans is widely reported in the literature as occurring in Serbia - the different statements almost certainly refer to the same taxon but only in a few cases is it possible to establish which taxa are intended. With reference to the historic distribution of T. natans and its relationship with man, there is wide speculation that its range was strongly influenced by its value as a crop. Arber (1920) states that T. natan s has been used from early times for food, medicine and magic, and is supposed to have been introduced into Switzerland as long ago as the period of the lake dwellings, while Vankina (1970) goes further to say that ""During the Atlantic and sub-boreal periods the area of distribution of T. natans stretched as far north as Middle Sweden and southern Finland. In Latvia, it appeared in the warm Atlantic period and has been found here at a total of 13 sites, including in the cultural layers of six settlement sites. At Sārnate, it has been found in dense layers of nutshells up to 40 cm thick around the hearths, occupying areas of several square metres. It has been suggested that the people of the Stone Age deliberately cultivated the water chestnut near their settlements. There is evidence that in the 16th century roasted water chestnuts or water chestnut flour were sold in the markets of Mantua and Ferrara. At the beginning of the same century, in southern France the water chestnut was consumed raw, boiled or roasted, and also used in the form of flour. It is known that during the time of the First World War the water chestnut was also sold at the market in the Latvian town of Jēkabpils. At around 900 BC, evidently as a result of climatic cooling, the water chestnut began to die out.""","Trapa natans appears to be very rare in the western European part of its range. It is extinct in Spain, there is only a single known population in Switzerland (Welten and Sutter 1982), two populations known in Greece. There are two populations currently known in Latvia (Lakes Pokrote near Balvi and Lakes Klaucāni and Priekulāni in Jēkabpils District). In Lake Klaucāni, the water chestnut grows in the western and southwestern bays of the lake, where it is protected from wind by forest, very near the lakeshore, where, at a depth of 2 m, the water on the lakebed during the vegetative period of the water chestnut retains a temperature of 21 degrees C. Nowadays, these sites have been placed under state protection (Vankina 1970).","Trapa natans is an annual (up to 3 m height) floating-leaved plant, growing in stagnant waters, lakes, channels with weak currents, ponds and marshes. It primarily occurs in unpolluted lowland nutrient-rich, but not strongly calcareous waters that have a muddy bottom and plenty of light; it is important as food source for birds and provides fish spawning grounds (Morgan and Leon 1992).","The causes of the decline in population s of T. natans are not clear, although they are usually attributed to loss and degradation of habitats. Vankina (1970) suggests that the current evidence of decline is simply part of a process that has been ongoing since 900 BC, due to cooling climate. If this is the case, then the current trends toward temperature increase may actually favour this species.","Trapa natans is included under Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and in the following national and regional red lists: Black Sea Region (Vulnerable) Bulgaria (Endangered) Carpathian Mountains (Endangered) Czech Republic (Critically Endangered) Germany (Endangered - level 2) Russia (Near Threatened) (I. Illarionova pers. comm. 2010) Slovakia (Vulnerable) Spain (Extinct) Sweden (Extinct) Switzerland (Critically Endangered) Turkey (Vulnerable) Ukraine (Endangered) In France, Trapa natans is protected at regional level (Alsace, Basse-Normandie, Limousin) and at departemental level (Ardennes). In Hungary, it is protected but not endangered.","The fruit of T. natans has apparently been a staple food source since the stone age, at least in Latvia where middens have been found with a depth of up to 40 cm of shells of this species (Vankina 1970), while it has been associated with the stone age lake dwellings in Switzerland (Keller 1866). The fruits were apparently sold in markets in Europe into the 16th century (Vankina 1970). The fruits are still important in continental Asia, Malaysia and India, especially in China. Several countries in southeast Asia, and also Chinese communities in Europe and North America, import the fruit directly from China. Fruits are used in the preparation of liniments to treat elephantiasis, pestilent fevers, rheumatism, sores, sunburn and skin complaints.

Its extracts are used to treat venous and capillary fragility and varicose veins following marked increases in newly formed capillaries and collagen fibrils. As potent antioxidants, anthocyanosides help prevent cell damage and strengthen capillaries by improving blood flow thereby helping maintain the flexibility and strength of cells to help prevent and treat varicose veins and spider veins. In Europe, bilberry is used prior to surgery to prevent excessive bleeding. Bilberry increases blood flow to the heart and other organs as well as to the legs. It also helps to thin the blood, reduce the risk of stroke and inhibit clot formation. Ingesting bilberries also appears to have some clinical value in preventing recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection amongst elderly patients (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003). Fructus Myrtilli consists of the dried ripe fruits of Vaccinium myrtillus . It can be administered by ingestion of fresh bilberry juice and fruit, crude drug, extracts, tablets, capsules which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. A tea made from the dried leaves is strongly astringent, diuretic, tonic and an antiseptic for the urinary tract. Other medicinal uses supported by clinical data include the oral use for the symptomatic treatment of dysmenorrhoea associated with premenstrual syndrome, circulatory disorders in patients with capillary leakage or peripheral vascular insufficiency and ophthalmic disorders. Its oral use in pharmacopoeias for the treatment of acute diarrhoea, local irritation or inflammation of the mucous membranes and a decoction of the leaves or bark is applied locally in the treatment of ulcers and in ulceration of the mouth and throat.

As a result Valeriana officinalis is receiving some indirect conservation (Joint Nature Conservation Committee 2012). It is listed as Near Threatened in Norway (Artsdatabanken 2010) and Least Concern in Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002) and the United Kingdom (Cheffings and Farrell 2005).,"The roots of Valeriana officinalis and other Valerian species have a long history of use in traditional medicine for restlessness and sleeping disorders. The World Health Organization (1999) summarised the uses supported by clinical data as a mild sedative, and sleep promoting agent, often used as a milder option over stronger sedatives, in the treatment of states of nervousness and overexcitement and anxiety induced sleep disturbances. It can be used to alleviate mild short term insomnia as the roots/rhizomes contain the active ingredient iridoid valepotriates, volatile oils, sesquiterpenes, pyridine alkaloids and chlorogenic acid. Valerian root is used for treating muscle and bronchial spasms and nervous conditions. It is often used in fixed combinations with hops ( Humulus lupulus ) as a herbal preparation from liquid and dry extracts and also lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ) and passion flower ( Passiflora incarnata) for treating nervousness and unrest. The essential oil acts as a depressant to the central nervous system and is prescribed as a remedy for hysteria, hypochondiasis, nervous unrest and also as an anticonvulsant in epilepsy. The major sedative components are monoterpene valepotriotes, used widely in Europe (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003, European Medicines Agency 2011). An essential oil from the leaves and root is used as a flavouring in ice cream, baked goods and condiments and the leaves can also be used as a condiment. The plant is used in moderation as a herbal tea. The roots of two year old plants are harvested in the autumn once the leaves have died down and are used fresh or dried, the fresh root being roughly three times as effective as dried roots (Plants for a Future 2012). In Poland, in particular in the Lublin region, Common Valerian belongs to the leading group of cultivated medicinal plants. There has been a long-term tradition in growing this plant but the quality and amount of raw herbal material is dependent on weed control and management and there has been difficulty in finding an effective herbicide for weed control without destroying the Valerian (Kwiatkowski 2010).","Khela, S."

It is listed as Least Concern in Denmark (NERI 2007), Estonia (eBiodiversity Estonia 2012), Germany (Ludwig and Schnittler 1996), Luxembourg (Colling 2005), Norway (Artsdatabanken 2010), Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002) and the United Kingdom (Cheffings and Farrell 2005).","The Speedwell has been known for possessing a range of healing properties and its folk use in Romania for treating stomach ulcers has been confirmed by experiments. Its use in folk medicine throughout the UK is rare except in Ireland where it was used for coughs and chest problems. In Germany this species is well reputed for pulmonary tuberculosis treatment (Allen and Hatfield 2004). It is also used to treat chronic skin diseases (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003). A bitter tangy tea is made from the fresh flowering herb or the dried leaves. The leaves and roots have been used for the treatment of pectoral and nephritic complaints, haemorrhages, skin diseases and treatment of wounds. The plant is considered to be obsolete in modern herbalism (Plants for a Future 2012).","Khela, S."

The berries have antibacterial and antioxidative properties (Sagdic et al . 2006). Viburnum opulus is a powerful antispasmodic and is used in the treatment of asthma, cramps and other conditions such as colic or painful menstruation and also as a sedative to remedy nervousness. The fresh bark contains scopoletin and is used to make a homeopathic remedy which is an antispasmodic, astringent and sedative and a tea can be used for treating spasms and cramps. The fruit can be eaten raw or cooked or used as a cranberry substitute however if ingested in large quantities its toxicity can can cause vomiting and diarrhoea. The leaves and fruits are antiscorbutic, emetic and laxative (Plants for a Future 2012). The specimens cultivated for ornamental purposes have sterile flowers (Castroviejo et al . 2007). Despite being of commercial interest the sources of Viburnum opulus as a raw material are limited in Lithuania; however all material in use is collected from wild sources (Raduöienė 2004).","Khela, S."

The area of occupancy (AOO) and population are also inferred to exceed these values and there are suspected to be no significant overall declines in population. It is assessed as Least Concern in Europe and the EU27.,Stable,"This plant is considered native in much of Europe (not found in northern Scandinavia and European Russia) and the Caucasus and its range extends into eastern Turkey (Pignatti 1982, Govaerts 2014, GRIN 2014). The species' natural range is obscured in Europe by historical introductions, but is considered an archaeophyte in most parts of its European range (e.g., United Kingdom, where first record of cultivation was in 995; Preston et al. 2002). The species has been introduced and naturalized elsewhere, for example, it is considered a category 2 invasive species in Ontario, Canada (Cymbaly 2007).","This plant is a widespread species, for example, it is reported from almost all of France (Tela Botanica 2013). Several thousand records, for Germany alone, are listed in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2014). The population is inferred to be very large and stable.","This is a spreading, perennial, evergreen plant, which roots at the stem nodes and can form large clonal colonies. The five petaled blue-violet flowers occur singly in the leaf axils. It flowers in spring. It is found in deciduous forest in partial shade on a variety of soils. It grows in lowlands and in hills and is widespread in woodlands. It is also found in hedgerows, banks and more open shrubby habitats.",There are not thought to be any major threats to this widespread and common species.,"This species is found within protected areas, for example the Natural Park of Serra de São Mamede in Portugal (Camejo-Rodrigues et al. 2004). It is cultivated ex situ in Botanic Gardens and germplasm is stored, for example, in the Woody Landscape Plant Germplasm Repository Maryland U.S.A. (GRIN 2014). In Europe, at present, no specific conservation actions are needed for this species, and it occurs within Natura 2000 sites.","This is considered to be an excellent ground cover plant, particularly for shaded areas, and is widely cultivated. It is a medicinal plant that has been used in European folk medicine to treat cerebral and memory disorders and a variety of other ailments such as constipation and bleeding (Grieve 1931, Plants for a Future 2012). It is reported to contain more than 50 alkaloids which have been shown to have a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect (Khanavi et al. 2010). A pharmaceutical drug Vincamine derived from the leaves of this species is marketed as a peripheral vasodilator that increases blood flow to the brain (Caymen Chemical 2013). The stems are also reportedly used in basket making (Plants for a Future 2012).","Chadburn, H."

V. canina is widespread but appears to be declining inland on heaths and now seems most common on sand dunes.,"Low to short hairless to slightly hairy perennial found in lowland acid grassland, open woods, grassy heathland, sandy commons, fens, lake shores, coastal dunes and pasture land often growing on acid soil (Blamey and Grey-Wilson 2003, Castroviejo et al. 1993, Preston et al. 2002). Fieldwork over the last ten years indicates that this species is scarce and should be looked for in close-cropped grassland, near the coast, river shingle, and seasonally wet loch margins and short cropped calcareous grassland (Amphlett 2010).","This species is threatened with changes in land use and loss of habitats such as heathland and acid grassland. It is also highly sensitive to nitrogen deposition and its distribution is inhibited by this. Increases in nitrogen deposition on heathland causes a shift in species composition with a reduction in occurrence of stress tolerant forbs and shrubs such as Viola canina . The presence of this species on acid grassland and upland heathland is significantly reduced with increased deposition (Joint Nature Conservation Committee 2011, Henrys et al. 2011).","Conservation and management of heathland and grassland through protection will help protect this species. It is listed as Endangered in the national red list of Luxembourg (Colling 2005), Near Threatened in the Netherlands (van der Meijden et al. 2000), Switzerland (Moser et al. 2002) and the United Kingdom (Cheffings and Farrell 2005), but is considered Least Concern in Denmark (NERI 2007) and Norway (Artsdatabanken 2010).",The young leaves and flower buds are edible raw or cooked and a tea can be made from the leaves. The flowers and leaves have powerful cathartic and emetic properties and are used for curing skin diseases (Plants for a Future 2012). The medicinal uses for this plant are limited.,"Khela, S."

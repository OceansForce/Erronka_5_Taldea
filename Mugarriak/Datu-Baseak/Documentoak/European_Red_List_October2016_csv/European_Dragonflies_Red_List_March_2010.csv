ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,ODONATA,EUPHAEIDAE,Epallage,fatime,,Epallage fatime is the only European representative of the Oriental family Euphaeidae. This family holds 69 species most of which are limited to the tropical parts of Asia.,,,NT,,NT,,European regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT). EU 27 regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT). The species has very likely experienced a decline in the European part of its range due to its small AOO and continuing decline in the extent and quality of the habitat. The species is mainly threatened by canalisation and pollution of its habitat. There is however no indication that this decline has been very strong. At present and in the future the species will probably be impacted by desiccation of brooks due to climate change and it is not unlikely that this will result in a strong decline in the next decade. For this reason the species is assessed as Near Threatened.,Decreasing,"Epallage fatime has a largely southwest Asian distribution. The easternmost records are from Afghanistan and Pakistan. From there it occurs widespread in the hills and lower mountains of Iran and Turkey to the mainland of Southeast Europe. It is absent from the Arabian Peninsula and the more arid parts of Iran, Iraq and Syria. It reaches south along a small fringe of the eastern Mediterranean occurring in western Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The species is not uncommon in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan and occurs in the Russian parts of the Caucasus but is absent further north. In Europe Epallage fatime is confined to Cyprus, some Greek islands and the southeast mainland of Europe. It is not rare in mainland Greece, European Turkey and the southeast of Bulgaria. Only one record is known from Macedonia but it is likely that some populations are present there. There is one published record from Hungary. This records is however very unlikely and is here considered invalid.",Epallage fatime has a limited range in Europe but seems to be relatively common in the areas where it occurs. It is often abundant when found and often several dozens of specimens are present in a stretch of one hundred meters.,"Epallage fatime occurs in areas with hills and lower mountains. It is exclusively found in running waters and seems to be limited to habitats with a stony substrate. Most often it is found in brooks and smaller rivers although it also occurs in small numbers in larger rivers. Larvae live under stones at places with high current. The legs are placed in an outstretched position and the abdomen and legs are flattened, both are probably adaptations to living in a strong current. In addition to this they are the only European species with sausage shaped lamellae and gills on the sides of their abdomen, both adaptations for the intake of oxygen. Based on this it has been suggested that they would be able to survive in stagnant water in times when current of the water stops due to desiccation. There is however no proof for this and the species seems to be lacking from habitats where there is no year-round current. Adults are found near the water resting on stones or, preferably, on higher vegetation near the water.",Agricultural practices along or nearby brooks resulting in pollution and canalisation of the habitat have probably had the most severe impact on this species in Europe. However many habitats where this species occurs lie in mountainous areas and are therefore relatively save from large scale agricultural practices. The main present and future threat seems to be climate change. Not only will this result in the desiccation of the habitat during spells of hot weather but this will also increase the use of the limited water resources for agricultural practices. Many new irrigation devices starting from tiny springs and headwater courses have been recently installed throughout Greece to compensate the present rainfall deficit.,This species has a limited European range and an evaluation should be made of the number of populations within reserves. Legalisation for the use of natural water resources for agricultural practices should be made.,"Kalkman, V.J."
ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,ODONATA,CORDULIIDAE,Somatochlora,borisi,,"Marinov & Seidenbusch (2007) place this taxon in a new monotypic genus, Corduliochlora. We refrain from using Corduliochlora as long as no overall phylogenetic study of the Corduliidae has been undertaken.",Yes,,VU,C1+2a(i),VU,C1+2a(i),"European regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU). EU 27 regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU). Currently there are no threats from traditional human activities in the area. However, future intensification of agriculture and of conifer plantations in connection to the extension of the European Union represent notable threats for the next 10 years. In addition, current climate warming with increased frequency, length and intensity of drought periods constitute a very strong threat for the species. The adult population size is probably less than 10,000 adults, and a decrease of 10% is expected during the next 10 years, due to more modern economic development, forest management and climate warming. Thus this species is listed as Vulnerable.",Decreasing,"Somatochlora borisi is a recently discovered species. Based on current knowledge of the species (Marinov 2001, Grebe et al. 2005, Boudot et al. 2004, Lopau 2005, Fleck et al. 2007) it is a strict endemic of the eastern Balkans occurring in the area that crosses the borders of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. All 17 known inhabited stream systems fall within a 13,750 km² area within both the Eastern Rhodopes and the northern and southern foot-slopes of the Istranca range, the latter being an eastern continuity of the Rhodopes range. This area has a hot and humid climate and has much forest cover, which is used both for wood production and traditional extensive rearing of goats and sheep. A number of valleys, when not planted with conifers, are well preserved and have a great entomological and botanical richness.","Seventeen stream systems are presently known to be inhabited by this species. Based on exuviae collections, counting and extrapolation during and after emergence of adults, the species seems relatively abundant in some places (100-500), and relatively reduced in others (less than 50). A rough extrapolation estimates less than 10,000 adults per year.","The main habitat are forest rivers at places with low current and below 300 m above sea level. Larvae are able to survive the drought summer period in disconnected residual pools in river beds. However, the species does not reproduce in standing water.","Most of the forest areas where this species occurs are currently extensively used for traditional rearing of goats and sheep, which result in a number of clearing areas. However, intensive conifer plantations have been grown in the past and such monospecific forest areas seem to be unfavourable for S. borisi. Monospecific plantations of Robinia pseudacacia are now developed on abandoned agricultural fields, which may reduce the availability of maturation and foraging areas. Additional conifer plantations, water pollution and stream drying in relation to global warming and abnormal summer drought may be a threat for this species in the future. As early as end July 2008, Greek localities visited showed only disconnected residual pools with no flowing water at all. With drought periods increasing in intensity, length and frequency, the species is at risk of extinction.","Necessary conservation actions are the control of water pollution, removal of conifer plantations and restoration of deciduous forests combined with the creation or maintenance of non-wooded sunny areas, particularly in the bottom of valleys. Conservation of clear riparian forests, traditionally induced by extensive rearing of goats and sheep, is required, as well as conservation of riverine trees. Two rivers inhabited by this species are included in the Greek national Dadia Protected Area buffer zone.","Boudot, J.-P."

More to the south, the species is known from five disjunct localities within a mountain area (800 - 2,000 m) ranging from the Altaï Mountains to the southwest of east Siberia. Most localities fall within the so-called ""treeline area"": tundra and mountain birch or dwarf pine forest above the Taiga.","In Europe, Somatochlora sahlbergi is one of the most elusive Odonata, as its range corresponds to the most cloudy and rainy area of Fennoscandia and northwest Russia. It has been scarcely observed, less than 25 records of single specimens or small populations are available. Larvae have been found in the Kevo area in several peaty pools showing more than 50 cm water depth and bordered with sedges according to Butler (1992). This kind of habitat is omnipresent in the subarctic birch belt and the tundra, so that the species is probably more widespread than believed, although not common.","In Europe, Somatochlora sahlbergi reproduces north of 67° N only. It favours both peaty pools with emergent vegetation of sedges, Myrica gale, and pools in Sphagnum peat bogs, within the tundra and the open stunted subarctic mountain birch forest belt (Betula pubescens tortuosa). It is often found in areas with permafrost. Little is otherwise known about its ecology.","A part of the European area of the species is under the influence of the atmospheric pollution issued from Russian industry at the north Kola Peninsula (acid deposition and heavy metals). As not much information is available about this species, it is not sure whether this poses a threat. It is also not clear how climate change would affect the species.",More research on population numbers and range and the biology and ecology as well as possible threats is needed. Appropriate conservation measures should be applied thereafter.,"Boudot, J.-P."

ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,ODONATA,CORDULIIDAE,Somatochlora,alpestris,,,,,LC,,LC,,"European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). Somatochlora alpestris is a habitat specialist, in the south of its range occurring in small populations. The species is widespread and common in parts of Fennoscandia and probably Russia with no indication of decline and therefore assessed as Least Concern. The isolated populations in Central Europe face some threats and should receive national attention.",Unknown,"Somatochlora alpestris is a typical boreoalpine species showing a fragmented area extending from eastern France to northern Fennoscandia, Siberia and northern Japan. Populations in Central Europe are confined to mountain ranges above 600 m a.s.l. only and are disconnected from the populations of Fennoscandia, northwest Russia and Siberia, which occurs down to sea level. The species is scattered throughout the Alps as well as in the Central European mountains ranging from the Vosges in France to the Harz in Germany and to the Carpathians in southwest Ukraine.","Adults of S. alpestris are easily overlooked and the total number which can be observed in a locality does not reflect the total number of exuviae which can be found during the emergence period. Based on exuviae, the population sizes are varying from one locality to another and are dependent on the micro-habitats that fit larvae requirement. The species is fairly common in the Alps and Fennoscandia, but occurs in small isolated populations in the rest of Central Europe.",S. alpestris favours small water bodies in Sphagnum bogs and transition mires. It also occurs in peat excavations. Adults show great sensitivity to summer weather conditions and are decimated by summer snowfalls exceeding 3 - 4 days. The species is tolerant to deep freezing and desiccation.,"In the northern part of its range, S. alpestris does not face any threats. In the southern part of its range, the species is threatened at lower altitudes. The pollution and destruction of peat bogs, peaty swamps and moorlands due to livestock excrements with eutrophication and trampling is a strong threat in the mountains of Central Europe. Tourism development may destroy some localities in the Alpine region. In addition, the natural succession of peaty habitats to dry lands may lead to the extinction of the species. Therefore, the abandonment of artisanal small scale peat extraction activities lead to peat bog closure in favour of ""dry"" heath, grasslands and forests. Climate change can reinforce this process.","No conservation measures are needed for the northern part of its range. In the south of its range, the protection of breeding habitats is needed and locally habitats should be preserved from access by livestock. The creation of water holes and small excavations in Sphagnum peat bogs is likely to create favourable micro habitats for this species and should be recommended whenever peat bogs become dry through natural succession or abnormal drought periods.","Boudot, J.-P."

In the south only scattered populations are recorded from Italy and the Balkans.,"S. flavomaculata is fairly common in Fennoscandia and northeast Europe and is scattered in the western and southern parts of its range. It occurs locally in large populations, however southern and western populations are frequently small. Since the 1980s an increase in abundance has been observed in the north and in the east.","The species generally prefers peaty water bodies with abundant vegetation. It occurs in fens, wet meadows, ponds, ditches, and edges of Sphagnum peat bogs. It is rarely found in slow-running waters.","There are no major threats to this species in northern and eastern part of its range where populations are increasing. In western and southern Europe the species is much more scarce and declined strongly in the 1960s to 1980s due to intensive land use (e.g. drainage). This decline seems to have stopped and recently an increase has been noted in part of this range. Increased drought periods related to climate change may lead to the drying up of additional marshes and to the extinction of several southern populations in the future. In Fennoscandia, climate change might favour this species development.","In most part of its range no conservation measures are needed at present. In some member states, the species is included in national Red Lists (Germany: EN; Austria: EN).

Somatochlora artica is widespread over West, Central and Northern Europe and is found in a wide range of altitudes. In the south it is confined to mountain regions as isolated lowland localities so that its range is fragmented there. The species is common, widespread and not threatened in large parts of northern Europe. Therefore the species is assessed as Least Concern on EU27 and European scale. However in Central and South Europe the species is scarce to rare occuring in isolated and often small populations. Here habitat loss due to climate change could lead to a rapid decline and the species is therefore of regional conservation concern.",Unknown,"It ranges from southwest France, Ireland and Scotland to North Japan. Somatochlora arctica is common in Fennoscandia and the Alps but is scarce to rare in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It occurs in some isolated areas in southwest Bulgaria and the Pyrenees.",The species is often difficult to find as the habitats may look unsuitable for dragonflies. Populations of adults of S. arctica are mostly small to medium large.,"S. arctica favours Sphagnum peat bogs and transition mires where the larvae are found at places with a very small amount of open water. These situations can be found at depressions, water holes, margins of small pools, peat excavations, moorlands and tundra. In its southern range it has a preference for higher altitudes.","No threats are present in the Fennoscandian and northern Russian part of its range. However, the species is threatened in Central and southern Europe. The destruction of peat bogs due to access by livestock, industrial peat extraction, forests and peaty waterbody management are a threat in lowlands and low elevation mountains and probably led to the destruction of habitats in the past. More recently, desiccation of several habitats has been reported under the influence of climate change (Ott 2006). Natural succession of the vegetation can lead to the reduction of available habitats.","No measures are needed in the Fennoscandian and northern Russian part of its range. The protection of breeding habitats is needed throughout Central Europe and habitats should be preserved from access by livestock. The creation of water holes and small excavations in Sphagnum peat bogs is likely to create favourable micro-habitats for this species and should be recommended whenever peat bogs become dry.

In Italy, it is recorded with certainty from Liguria only; records from Sicily may be due to a confusion with some infrarank forms of C. splendens without or with a very narrow hyaline fringe at wings tip (C. s. caprai, C. s. balcanica). Records from North Africa were old and unclear and were most probably erroneous. In the contact area between C. xanthostoma and C. splendens, both taxa are reported to hybridize, for example in Liguria and between the Loire and Garonne in France, with decrease of C. xanthostoma in favour of C. splendens through genetic assimilation. This and genetic distance analysis between both taxa suggest that C. xanthostoma is a relict taxa that survived the Pleistocene glaciations in the west Mediterranean refugium but is presently challenged by post glacial invaders, with introgression and replacement processes.",This species is fairly common and abundant in its main area.,"This species favours open and moderately shaded running waters. It avoids cold torrents, high mountains and deep shade, but is found in slow-flowing areas in large water courses where C. splendens also occurs (for example, lowland rivers and canals).","Destruction of habitat through gravel pitting and tourism infrastructures as well as water pollution by human activities are the main threat for this endemic species.

EU 27 regional assessment: Endangered (EN). Boyeria cretensis is endemic to the island of Crete, Greece. Its present known extent of occurrence is about 2,120 km² (polygon method) and the species is presently known only from 21 places spread over 11 streamlets. Overall, there are no more than 2,500 mature individuals left in these populations. A future population and range decline is expected due to climate change and rapid habitat destruction due to water exploitation. All lotic (flowing water) habitats in Crete are endangered given the present climate trend and related increased water captation (capturing water at its source) developed as a reaction. Therefore this species is listed as Endangered.",Decreasing,"Boyeria cretensis is endemic to the island of Crete (Greece). Most individuals are found in small subpopulations isolated by high mountain systems and dry areas: a first aggregate of five river systems is known west of the Lefka Ori mountains in the westernmost part of Crete, another of 11 river systems lies between the Lefka Ori and the Psiloritis (Mount Idi) mountains and north of the latter in Central Crete, whereas one single isolated locality was found east of the Dikti mountains in the easternmost part of Crete (Battin 1989, Boudot et al. 2009, Lopau 2000, Schneider and Müller 2006).","The species occurs generally in small populations, but a population of more than 110 adults has been recorded in one place. It is known that the species is extinct in the type locality and it is believed to be extinct in four other localities.","The species is highly specific in its habitat, being associated with the upper courses of permanent shady brooks with moderate current and rock pools. The distribution of this endemic dragonfly is restricted to rivulets with permanent water and pronounced gallery vegetation in a narrow belt between 50 and 600 m above sea level belonging to the thermo-Mediterranean and meso-Mediterranean zone of Crete.","B. cretensis has presumably declined as a result of rapid habitat destruction and degradation, human exploitation of water, water pollution, eutrophication and forest destruction. B. cretensis is threatened due to its very restricted distribution, its low number of known localities (26 places on 17 streamlets) and its high level of stenotopy (adapted to a specific environment). The current agricultural policy favours the decrease of B. cretensis by allowing for and favouring the cultivation and irrigation of olive trees, the change of water regime of streams and streamlets and the destruction of their gallery vegetation. Many populations are small and relatively isolated. Climatic change alone will also have a negative impact on breeding sites in the future, but this is already exacerbated by the increased water demand for agriculture and urbanized areas.","Control of water use and preservation of gallery forest are required. The extractions of water from springs and headwaters should be absolutely prohibited, whereas this kind of alteration is clearly increasing throughout Greece as a response to climate change. Erection of natural reserves involving the upper course of Cretan brooks is necessary. Mapping of populations is also needed, as current records are limited (only 21 from 1980 onwards).

Anax ephippiger is a wide-ranging and abundant species with no evidence of decline. In Europe it will probably benefit from climate change. It is assessed as Least Concern on European scale.,Stable,"Anax ephippiger has a very wide range, including large parts of Africa extending over Arabia eastwards to India where it typically occurs in arid and semiarid areas. It shows very strong migratory behaviour and is sometimes found migrating in enormous numbers and huge distances. The species reproduces in fluctuating numbers in southern Europe. Yearly these migration waves from Africa and Arabia reach Europe but the numbers of individuals arriving vary strongly from year to year. This migration rarely reached central and north Europe and in these years it can turn up anywhere in Europe even reaching as far as Iceland (Tuxen 1976). The most notable of these influxes took place in 1995 when the species was found all over the continent (Burbach and Winterholler 1998). In Central Europe specimens arriving in spring might successfully reproduce resulting in emergence in late summer of the same year. The most northern cases of reproduction are from the south of Germany and western Poland (Burbach and Winterholler 1997, Bernard and Musiał 1995). Larvae are however not capable of surviving the winter in Central Europe.","In its main range, from Africa to India, it is one of the most common and widespread species present. In southern Europe, the species is scarce although it can be found in large numbers. In the remainder of Europe, it is rare and in many countries it is only known from migrants (only one or two individuals). The numbers of emerging individuals can be however large at reproduction sites (Corbet 2000).","The biology of the species is strongly adapted to breeding in seasonal habitats. In its main range migrating individuals travel with rain bearing winds which lead them to areas with rain. Here the species lays eggs, often at the end of the winter, in standing waters created by the rainfall (Corbet 1999, Dumont and Desmet 1990, Dumont 1977). The larvae have a rapid growth completing their development in two to three months allowing them to emerge before the habitat dries out. Like in its main range the European breeding sites also consist mainly of standing, shallow and often seasonal waters. Due to the seasonality of the water the amount of vegetation is often very limited. The low water table and the lack of vegetation make that the temperature of the water is high allowing a rapid growth of the larvae. As can be expected for a species living mainly in seasonal waters the larvae tolerate high salinity. Most reproduction sites in Europe are found in coastal wetlands.",Large scale development of coastal Mediterranean wetlands is a threat for this species.,This species is relatively save and probably will benefit from climate change.

These fields are found in standing or slowly flowing, largely unshaded waters with a mesotrophic to moderately eutrophic status. Natural habitats where this species can occur are lakes or oxbows. In Western Europe occurrences in more natural habitats have become rare and there it is mainly found in man-made waters like large ditches and channels in low peat areas.","Aeshna viridis is almost completely dependent on the presence of fields of WaterSoldier. This species quickly disappears when water becomes polluted, especially when the amount of phosphate rises. The decrease of water-quality due to poor water management is the main threat for this species on European scale. At least in Western Europe relatively many populations are found in agricultural areas. Here the increase of maize production is a specific threat. All throughout its range, but especially in Western Europe this species occurs in man-made waters like ditches and channels.

Most of its European range is found in Russia and although very little is known on the distribution of dragonflies in this country it seems to be reasonably widespread and not rare in the north and across the Ural to the south. The species is therefore assessed as being of Least Concern on European scale. The distribution of the species within the 27 member states of the European Union is small as it is confined to the southern quarter of Finland and ca. 10 localities in Lithuania and Latvia.

Based on limited information it seems that densities in suitable habitat normally vary from tens to several hundreds of specimens.,"In Finland and the Baltic states Aeshna crenata is mostly found at pools and small to medium sized forest lakes which are acid and poor in nutrients. In most cases the banks are covered with a vegetation of peat moss (Sphagnum) and sedges (Carex) and mature forest is found in the direct vicinity. In the northern and eastern parts of European Russia, the habitat spectrum is larger comprising also river valleys, larger lakes and dead river arms with vegetation of Water Horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile) and sedges (Carex).",Most European populations are found in areas with relatively little human pressure.

The species is moderately common to common in large parts of Central and Northern Europe. Its habitats are not under specific threats and there is no indication for a decline. Some isolated occurrences in the Mediterranean part of Europe might be threatened by climate change. These populations are however of marginal importance compared to its main range. The species is therefore assessed as being of Least Concern.,Stable,"Aeshna grandis is a largely European species that is found east to the lake Baikal area. Its European range is largely confined to Central and Northern Europe. Its continuous range goes south to the Massif Central, the Alps and the mountains of Romania.

In the south of its range, already in the south of Germany, the species becomes largely confined to mountainous areas. It is reasonably common in much of its Central European range but becomes almost omnipresent and abundant in the north and northeast of its range.

In the Ukraine, it is mostly distributed in the north, becomes more rare in the south and is absent in the Black Sea region.",The species is widespread in most of its Central and Northern European range and becomes scarcer and more confined to mountains towards the south. In the south of its range populations are often more isolated and relatively small. Although widespread in much of Central Europe the numbers are often low and at most reproduction habitats only several to a few dozens of emerging adults can be found each year. The species is more common in the north and northeast of its range and the numbers of specimens emerging from a single habitat is often higher there.,"In the northern part of its range it is found in a wide variety of standing and slowly flowing waters. The species is found at a large variety of habitats such as larger pools, lakes, canals, oxbows and fenlands. It is also found in water storage areas, ponds, ditches and peat excavations. Most habitats have in common that they are situated in forested areas and have a rich bank side or submerged vegetation. In the south and west of its European range, the species is absent from habitats in the early stages of succession and seems to need more mature habitats. The numbers of emerging adults found at a single site is generally low which led to the suggestion that several suitable habitats at close distance from each other are needed to have a vital population. This seems to be true for most of Central Europe, however in Eastern Europe the situation might be different.

There are no indications for a strong decline in the northern, main part of its range. In Central Europe it is showing a decline but this is less than 30% in the past ten years and not expected to be 30% in the next decade. This species is likely to be impacted by climate change, which might result in a rapid decline and local extinctions in parts of Central Europe.

The species is therefore assessed as Least Concern.",Decreasing,"Aeshna caerula ranges from Scotland to Kamchatka Peninsula in the east. It has a boreal-alpine distribution being common and widespread in the Taiga and Tundra areas and having a patchy distribution in mountains further south. It is one of the most northerly species in the world extending to the North Cape. In Europe its lowland areal goes south to Scotland, the south of Sweden, northern Latvia and the northern parts of Russia. In the Siberian part of its range its lowland distribution reaches further south to the area of lake Baikal. In central Europe the species is confined to mountains and it is reasonably widespread in the Alps, seemingly scarce and localised in the Sudety mountains from the northern Czech Republic to southern Poland and in the Carpathians in northern and eastern Slovakia. It is scarce in the western parts of the Bohemian Forest (Šumava). In Slovakia it occurs close to the Ukraine border and it is likely to be present in this country as well. The species has been mentioned for the Bihar mountains in Romania but this record has never been confirmed and although the occurrence of this species in Romania is not unlikely it is here regarded as doubtful. A record from Gomelskaya oblast in the south of Belarus was published without further information and is also considered doubtful and assumed incorrect. If true it would constitute the southernmost lowland record in Europe (Buczyński et al. 2006). In its Central European range it does not occur below 800 m and almost all records are from 1,000 m or above.In some central European countries the species is limited to a small number of populations making it vulnerable for local extinction. In Poland, Czech Republic as well as in Slovakia it has a very patchy distribution. In France Aeshna caerulea is known with certainty only from four localities from the Haute-Savoie department (municipalities of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, Vallorcine and Samoëns), within a range of 1,700-2,200 m. In Italy the species was only known from three localities until 2006. The record above Passo Rolle (Dolomiti) has been confirmed but the two other localities, the Lago di Chiesa in Valmalenco (1,600 m, Lombardy) and a pond in Val Vallaga (2,000 m Alto Adige) are in need of confirmation. From 2006 onwards, six new localities were found in Alto Adige (Libella Group, pers comm.). In Slovenia, the species is only known from one record, and so far, no populations have been found. In Germany the species is limited to Baden-Württemberg (one population in the Black Forest) and two regions in the south of Bayern.","The species is common in the northern part of its range where it is one of the most common dragonfly species. To the south of its lowland range it is already getting scarcer being more confined to higher areas and occurring in smaller numbers. The species is scarcer in the central European mountain range, where many populations are isolated and small, although larger population with several thousands of specimens have also been found there.","Aeshna caerulea is adapted to live in areas with long, strong winters and short summers with a low air temperature. This enables the species to live in areas where most other dragonflies are unable to live. It seems that in warmer areas it is out-competed by other dragonflies such as Aeshna juncea. In colder areas its range of habitats seems to be broader probably due to the reduced pressure of other species. In the north of Europe, in its lowland range, the species is present in standing waters and sometimes in slowly running waters. Here it can be found in bog pools and sedge swamps in moors, heaths and tundra’s. Above the tree line it is mostly found in peaty pools. In its central European, mountainous part of its range the species is exclusively found in standing waters above 800 m. Here it is found in permanent waters of mostly 5 to 80 m2 surface and with a water depth of generally 20 cm or less. The vegetation consists of Sphagnum, sedges (Carex) and Cottongrass (Eriophorum). The water is frozen for a large part of the year. The water temperature can however rise quickly during day-time in spring and summer to temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius.","In the north of its range the species is mainly found in areas with low environmental pressure. Most of the populations in the central European mountains are also located in areas with relatively little human impact. However, populations in farmland or in touristic areas are threatened by the impacts of cattle trampling the vegetation and tourist activities (introduction of fish, boats). The distribution of the species is largely determined by its need for a cold climate reducing the competition of other species. Climate change is likely impacting the distribution of this species already. The impact is likely to be most severe in its Central European range where there are more isolated occurrences. Especially the populations in the western parts of the Tatra, Sudety mountains and the Bohemian Forest are threatened as there are relatively few populations which mostly lie at altitudes which are already on the verge of its climatological possibilities.",Especially the central European populations should be protected from the impact of grazing by cattle and from tourist activities. There is no need for conservation measures for the northern populations. The main threat is probably climate change. Except from increasing the amount of available habitat there is little which can be done to counterbalance the impact of climate change.,"Kalkman, V.J."

In some of these areas conversion of land to arable land or improvements of agricultural land may lead to the destruction of habitats on a large scale.",Stable,"Aeshna isoceles is a largely European species occurring east through Turkey, the Levant to the Caucasus and the border of the Caspian Sea in Iran. The species is rare in North Africa and confined to the northern Maghreb. Except for isolated populations in Norfolk and Suffolk it is absent in Ireland and Great Britain. To the north it is found to the southern tip of Sweden, Gotland and Latvia. Although it is distributed over a large part of Europe it is rare to absent in large areas. This pattern seems to be largely explained by its preference for warmer areas combined with its preferences for extensive reed marshes or beds of Water Soldier (Stratiotes aloides). Due to this it is absent from mountain areas and large parts of the north (too cold) while it is rare for instance in the Iberian Peninsula and large parts of Germany, probably due to the lack of extensive reed marshes.","The species has a large European range although it is in many areas rare to absent. In areas where it does occur it can be very abundant and is often found in high numbers. Regionally the species seems to have declined in the recent past. Good indication for this is known from Belgium and some parts of Germany (De Knijf et al. 2006, Ott and Piper 1998). On the other hand a strong increase has been seen in areas such as Britain, northeast France and the Netherlands.","Aeshna isoceles prefers extensive bank vegetation of reed, bullrush (Typha) or Water Soldier (Stratiotes aloides). Throughout its range it reproduces at reed beds at standing or sometimes slowly flowing waters like channels, marshes, ponds, and lakes. In the north of its range it is often abundant at vegetations of Water Soldier (Stratiotes aloides), which occurs in standing water of good quality, mostly in low peat areas. Preferred are sunny habitats, that have some shelter from the wind and are never largely shaded.","There is no indication for a major decline throughout its range. However, due to the patchiness of its distribution there are many areas with isolated occurrences and regionally the species is often threatened. In areas where it is mainly found in vegetation with Water Soldier (Stratiotes aloides) the species is mainly threatened by a decline of this plant due to decrease of water quality. Especially the increase of phosphate in the water seems to induce major decline of this plant. Also mismanagement of vegetation of Water Soldier is a threat. Without management these vegetations will ultimately disappear and dredging the plants of Water Soldier every two or three years is needed to maintain the vegetation. However mismanagement might lead to the removal of all Water soldier vegetation in an area at once, which has a negative impact on the species. The species is less susceptible for the water quality in areas where the species mainly occurs in vegetation with reed. Here alteration of the habitat or a too intensive use of the banks is a threat.Especially in Central and Western Europe much suitable habitat went lost in the last century due to the conversion of marshland to farmland or to the further improvement of farmland. This issue has become less pressing in Central Europe, however it is not unlikely that large amounts of suitable habitat are being converted in order to improve farmland in eastern Europe.","The species is not threatened on a European level. The species is however rare in some regions and has shown locally a strong decline. At these locations, management plans for the conservation and restoration of habitats are needed.","Kalkman, V.J."

There is no evidence of decline, nor any specific threats.",Increasing,"Aeshna affinis is distributed from Europe eastwards to Mongolia. In Europe its main range is found in the south although it is relatively uncommon in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of Italy. It favours warm summers and in Europe it occurs more northerly in the east of its range probably as result of the higher summer temperatures in that region. The recent increase in summer temperature has led to an expansion of its European range to the north which led to the species becoming established in The Netherlands, northern Germany and being recorded for the first time in Denmark in 2006.","The species is rare north of the Alps and the Loire but widespread in South Europe. In the southern parts of the Ukraine it is common but in other parts such as the Iberian Peninsula it is scarce. The number of specimens varies strongly per site, ranging from some specimens to 1,000.","The species exclusively reproduces at standing waters. It prefers shallow, well-vegetated waters sheltered from the wind and exposed to the sun. Many of the habitats dry up partially during summer and become covered with vegetation often including rushes (Juncus), sedges (Carex) or low reed (Phragmites). In Italy, it was also found in rice fields in the past.",The species is currently not threatened.

EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). Although the habitat of this species in Northeast Europe and its distribution in Southeast Europe are poorly known it is not likely that the species is currently threatened. The species is therefore assessed as Least Concern on European scale.,Stable,"The main range of this species is found in the open and half open steppes of the temperate parts of Asia from where it occurs east to Kamchatka (Dumont 2005). In the west it is known from single records from Armenia and from lake Van in Turkey. In the south of the Ural it is common at steppe and forest-steppe lakes (Yanybaeva et al. 2006). It is likely that it is occurring in parts of southern Russia, however information on this area is poor. There are two old records from the eastern parts of the Ukraine and one recent record but all these records need to be validated. Suitable habitat might be present and given the fact that this region is poorly explored it seems not unlikely that populations of the species are present here. An isolated occurrence of the species is found around the Baltic Sea. Here the species is found at one Russian island, the coast of Estonia, Finland and Sweden, only in the latter country it is also found in inland localities. Recently a male was found in the north of Denmark. It is unknown if the records in Denmark refer to just a vagrant or whether there is a local population. There is one record from the Komi Republic in northern Russia. This record has however not been verified and is here regarded as doubtful (Peters 1997).",In the southern Ural the species was found to be common (Yanybaeva et al. 2006). The paucity of records west of the Ural seems to suggest that it is here much more scarce or absent. Although the species has a small range along the Baltic sea it is often common and abundant when found.,"Aeshna serrata is found in larger standing waters and is, compared to the closely related A. crenata, more found in open landscapes. In the southern Ural the species is found in steppe and forest steppe lakes' (Dumont et al. 2005). In the interior parts of Sweden, it occurs at open eutrophic lakes and pools with extensive beds of reed (Phragmites sp., Typha spp.). In the surroundings of the Baltic Sea the species seems to have a preference for brackish waters. The species is found at vegetation of reeds on the banks of the Baltic sea and at nearby wetlands.","At the moment no specific threats are known. Little is known on the situation in the southern Ural but presumably the species is not strongly threatened there. The Baltic population is dependent on coastal wetlands. Development for tourism on the coast of Estonia and Finland could be a threat to the species. It is not unlikely that the majority of the Baltic population breeds in the Baltic Sea or in habitats strongly influenced by the Baltic Sea. Changes in the water quality of the Baltic Sea could therefore potentially be a threat to this species.In Sweden, populations are included in protected bird areas. Flooding the area for bird protection measures has negative impacts on the reed bed habitat.",Relatively little is known on the biology and the main habitat of this species adjacent to the Baltic Sea. Information on this is needed to better understand its conservation status. The range of this species in southern Russia outside the Ural and eastern Ukraine is unknown. Information on this would help to understand the conservation status of this species.,"Kalkman, V.J."

It seems that in cooler climates the darker type prevails while in the lowland of central Europe the paler type is more common. These types can be found together and are at least partly determined by climatological circumstances and are therefore not considered to be subspecies.,,,LC,,LC,,European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). There are no indications of a strong decline in Northeast and the north of Central Europe. There are some indications that it is declining in parts of its central European range and it is not unlikely that a rapid decline will be seen in this part of its range over the next ten years. Its Central European distribution is very small compared to its distribution in the north of Europe and a decline in this part of Europe will not impact strongly on its conservation status in Europe. The species is therefore assessed as Least Concern.,Decreasing,"Aeshna subarctica elisabethae occurs in the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. In Europe, the species is largely confined to the northeast. It is probably common in large parts of the north of European Russia from where its range continues to Finland, Sweden and Norway. The species is also moderately represented in the Baltic states, northern Poland and probably in northern Belarus although only a handful of records are available. Its lowland area continues from there to northern Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. More to the south it is known from more isolated occurrences at higher altitudes in Belgium, France, southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, southern Poland. An isolated record is known from Bulgaria. The occurrence of this species in the Balkans was never confirmed and this record is considered to be doubtful.",Its specific habitat requirements make the species uncommon and sparse in large parts of its range. Densities at suitable sites can however be high.,"The species is confined to moors and bogs with vegetation of Sphagnum. These are most often natural waters in large moors but can also be habitats created by peat extraction. Its specific habitat requirements make that it is confined to higher altitudes in central Europe. The majority of the populations are found in bogs with floating peatmoss, which serves as larval habitat. Less often the species is found in habitats where the peatmoss is part of the bankside vegetation or is lying on the bottom.",Most populations are found in areas with relatively little human activity or in nature reserves and this species is therefore safe from large-scale habitat destruction. In areas where only small pieces of moors and peatbog still exist the ceasing of peat extractions is an increasing problem. In these places the aquatic habitats might fall dry as a result of natural succession of the vegetation. The same effect could be caused by climate change in southcentral Europe.,"In its central European lowland range, large-scale restoration of peat moors will help the long-term survival of this species in the region. In areas with isolated populations the species might be threatened by natural succession of the vegetation. The creation of pits in peat bogs may offer in these cases new reproductive habitats. In the future this species might be strongly impacted by climate change especially in central Europe. Monitoring of populations, especially those ones that are isolated is therefore advisable.","Kalkman, V.J."

Aeshna juncea is widespread and common in a large part of Europe and no strong decline is expected to occur. For these reasons the species is assessed as Least Concern.Isolated occurrences in central Europe and especially in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan are likely to be affected by Climate Change. Aeshna juncea deserves attention in these areas.,Stable,"Aeshna juncea has the largest range of all Aeshna species occurring in the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. In Europe it is widespread and common in the north. Towards the south it becomes scarcer and in southern central Europe it is largely confined to higher altitudes.

It is fairly common and widespread in the Alps and the Pyrenees but is scarce and known only from scattered localities in the mountains of the Balkans and of the Iberian Peninsula.","The species is fairly common in most of its range and often abundant when found, especially in mountain areas (alpine areas). It is rare in Iberia, but locally common in the Pyrenees.","Aeshna juncea is confined to standing, largely unshaded habitats. Throughout its range bogs seem to be the preferred habitat. The species favours cooler climates and can be found in a wider range of habitats in Scandinavia and at high altitudes (>1,000 m) in central Europe including slow flowing waters. At lower altitudes in Central Europe the vast majority of the populations is found in bogs with Sphagnum and sedges or rushes. More rarely and in lower numbers it is found in other habitats such as quarries, garden ponds, dune pools, fens or low peat areas with fields of Water Soldier. In the southwest of its range it is largely confined to nature reserves and it is found mostly in natural or semi-natural habitats.","In the past, the populations in Central and Southern Europe have decreased due to habitat destruction such as deforestation and agricultural expansion. Most southwestern populations are found in nature reserves. Nutrification had a negative impact on the species but it seems less susceptible to this than many other species occurring in bogs. The most important future threat is likely to be climate change resulting in the alteration of peat bogs. This will certainly impact the more isolated populations in South and southcentral Europe such as the populations on the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkans.","The species is safe in much of its northern and central European range. Isolated occurrences in central Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkans require attention. Fieldwork is needed in Iberia and the Balkans in order to identify the main populations.

It has a clear preference for small and at least partly shaded waters. When it occurs at larger water bodies it shows a clear preference for those parts which are visually demarked from the main part of the water, for instance by some higher vegetation. The species needs waters where at least parts of the bottom are free of emerging vegetation. These situations can be found in pools which are still in the early stages of succession or more often in pools where leaves from nearby trees and bushes cover a part of the bottom. It is often the only dragonfly to be present in small, largely shaded forest pools often with no substrate other than leaf litter and in this situation larvae can occur in very high densities. In Central Europe it is also one of the most common dragonflies at garden ponds. The species is able to resist weeks of desiccation.Adult males are highly territorial and often only a small fraction of the actual adult population is found at the waterside.

Sympecma fusca is a wide-ranging and abundant species showing no indications of decline. The species is assessed as Least Concern.,Stable,Sympecma fusca is largely confined to the Western Palaearctic and more than half of its area of distribution lies in Europe. The species is widespread and regionally common in southern and central Europe. S. fusca is expanding its range northwards in the Netherlands and Sweden since the 1990s. The species is almost absent from European Russia. Its distribution in Belarus is poorly known.,The species is generally common in its range and is often abundant. In some countries such as Hungary it is one of the most common damselflies.,"Sympecma fusca occurs at standing or slow-flowing waters with abundant vegetation and the presence of dead, floating plants in spring. The latter must have a soft tissue as they are used for oviposition. A wide variety of habitats are used, such as bogs, marshes, large lakes and gravel pits. The species mates and lays eggs in early spring, emerges in summer and hibernates as adult. This has consequences for the preferred habitat. The habitat needs to have a warm local climate allowing the adult to be active already in the period from February to April. Larvae need to develop fast in a period of only several weeks to three months and thus need relatively warm water with a high abundance of prey allowing a fast growth. After emergence the adults need place to feed after which they disperse to their wintering site. The wintering site is often at several kilometres distance from the reproduction site. Wintering often takes place in dead herbs or grasses of half a meter to a meter high near or in open forest.","For unclear reasons the species showed a decline in at least the northwestern part of its range in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s the species had become rare in large parts of Central and western Europe and was deemed threatened on several national Red Lists such as those of Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. Since then, the species has shown a strong increase and presently it is not believed to be under threat in any of the European states.

The latter three names are still sometimes used for subspecies occurring in the southeast of its range. These subspecies are largely based on the reduced dark pattern on the thorax. This character is however merely correlated with the hot climate of Central Asia where specimens become gradually paler over a large area.

In the Alps, the species has declined and is probably still declining. Without measurements taken in this region it is likely the species will be lost from some parts of this area. The species is assessed as Least Concern but conservation measures are needed in the west of its range to prevent local extinction.",Decreasing,"Sympecma paedisca has a huge range occurring from western Europe to Japan. Most of its range lies in the temperate zone and the species is largely lacking from the boreal region. In Europe the species is rather common and widespread in the northeast only. This area includes northern and eastern Poland, the Baltic States, Belarus, northern Ukraine and Russia. In western Europe, it is limited to a small band running from the Netherlands across northern Germany. The species has a relict distribution in the Alps (in Italy in Piedmont region) and the mountains in the west of the Czech Republic. Sympecma paedisca went through a severe decline in both western Europe and the Alps. Recently it is increasing in the Netherlands, Germany and expanding its range in Finland and probably Sweden.","Sympecma paedisca is widespread and often common in parts of eastern Europe. In the west of its range, it is scarce and localised. The localities where it occurs are, however, often formed by large systems such as lakes or large fenlands. Due to this fact, most populations are relatively large and not seldom the species is found in high numbers.","Sympecma paedisca is found in a remarkably wide variety of habitats. In Europe, it occurs in mesotrophic to moderately eutrophic standing, or seldom slowly flowing, waters. These range from large lakes, fenlands, peat bogs to gravel pits. The habitat always has an abundant bank side and aquatic vegetation. As in S. fusca, the adults hibernate during winter and mate and lay eggs in early spring. Emergence of the larva takes place in the second half of the summer after which most adults leave the vicinity of the reproduction site to hibernate at localities often at several kilometres distance of their larval habitat. Different habitat types can be suitable for wintering as long as there is a vegetation of knee-high herbs or grasses on several sides bordered by higher bushes or trees. The low vegetation is used in autumn for foraging and as hideout in winter whereas the surrounding higher vegetation provides shelter from the wind. In the Netherlands it was noted that the adults prefer relatively dry conditions during winter probably as moisture increases the chances on fungus diseases.","There are no threats known in eastern Europe. As for many dragonflies, habitat destruction played a major role in its decline in West Europe during most of the 20th century. The degradation of habitat quality seems to have become the key factor in its decline in the last decades. Eutrophication resulting in a decrease of the quality and quantity of aquatic and floating vegetation played a role in large parts of West Europe. In the Netherlands and in northern Germany, the abandonment of traditional management might have been a key factor. The ceasing of the extraction of peat and the decrease in land area where reed is mowed, resulted in a dramatic drop of the amount of aquatic and floating vegetation and the increase of woodland in traditionally more open fenland (Ketelaar et al. 2007). At least in the Netherlands the extraction of peat in order to restore the amount of aquatic and floating vegetation resulted in a subsequent increase of S. paedisca.","This species is included on the EU Habitats Directive Annex IV and for this reason it is likely that for many reproduction sites management plans will be made in the near future. Especially for isolated occurrences as found in West Europe and the Alps management plans are needed. In Italy, the distribution of the species is poorly known making it presently impossible for this country to give this species the protection required according the EU legislation. The habitats used by S. paedisca in West Europe for reproduction are almost always of high biodiversity value and often these habitats have a very rich dragonfly fauna. The species is therefore a strong indicator of habitat quality.","Kalkman, V.J."

S. depressiusculum is generally rare, has a patchy distribution and has shown a strong decline throughout most of its European range. It is estimated that this decline has been over 30% in the last ten years and might be over 30% in the next ten years. The species is therefore assessed as Vulnerable on European scale, even if in the near future, agricultural development in Eastern European Countries may lead to a decrease and loss of habitat and the species could mach the Endangered category.",Decreasing,"Sympetrum depressiusculum ranges from Europe to the Pacific coast of Asia. In Japan, it is an invasive species from the Asian mainland. Its European range covers Central, East and Southeast Europe. The species has a patchy distribution and there are large areas within its main range where it is rare to absent. A strong decline has taken place nearly everywhere from the second half of the 20th century onwards. The species is very rare (close to extinction) in Italy and in southern France with the last record from the Camargue dating back to 1987. The only known populations in France are found in the Rhone Valley and it seems to be extinct in the rest of the country. Strong declines and regional extinctions are also known from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.","Sympetrum depressiusculum is scarce throughout its European range and population numbers have dropped in many areas in Europe. In the past the species was locally very abundant. In Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy the number of sites and populations has decreased by more than 50% in the last decade (De Knijf et al. 2006, Deliry et al. 2008, Ott et al. in press). However, in Poland, the species seems to be stable but this is possibly due to a lack of recent data.","The species shows strong regional differences in habitat preferences. The key factor seems to be that it needs unshaded, often shallow and warm waters. Typically they become dry towards the end of the summer until next spring. Those situations can be found at borders of large lakes and in marshes. These kinds of situations are also found in fishponds and rice paddies in South Europe.","Major threats to this species are changes in rice cultivation in southern Europe and fish aquaculture and increasing use of ponds for angling in northern and central Europe, that has led to changes and destruction of its habitat. As a consequence to this habitat loss there is higher larval competition with other dragonflies species and predation by fish.Climate change will probably impact this species but it is difficult to predict if this will be positive or negative.","Considering the relatively low number of strong populations in most countries it is advisable that for each of these the conservation status is determined and, if necessary, management plans are made. Protection of breeding sites is absolutely needed, preventing the intensive use of ponds for angling and through regulation of rice field management. The current agricultural practises at rice fields make them unsuitable for S. depressiusculum. It is however not unlikely that relatively small adaptations in the management of rice fields will increase the biodiversity without decreasing the production of rice. Research in order to see if this applies for S. depressiusculum is needed.","Kalkman, V.J."

Information on the current status of the three known populations is not available. Based on the habitat requirements of the species and the strong pressure on aquatic habitats on each of the three mentioned islands it is inferred that the species has shown a strong decline and is very likely to continue declining. In addition to this the Area of Occupancy is probably less than 10 km2 and only three locations are known with no possibilities for exchange between these populations. Based on the above the species is assessed as Critically Endangered.",Decreasing,"Ceriagrion georgifreyi has a relatively small range and occurs along a narrow coastal strip in the northern half of Israel, West Syria, southern Turkey and three Greek islands. Records of Ceriagrion from Lesvos and from continental Greece published as C. tenellum may refer to C. georgifreyi. No voucher specimens are available for these records and new fieldwork needs to be undertaken to establish the identity of these populations. A record of C. georgifreyi from Niksar in north Turkey was reported by Schneider (1986) based on a series from the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh. This population belongs to the northern limit of the species and may tentatively be recognized as valid, although a label error or a problem of homonymy in the locality name cannot be ruled out. In Europe the species is only known from three Greek islands. From each of these islands only a single record is available: Kerkyra (1971), Thasos (1997) and Zakynthos (1998) (Kalkman 2005).",In Europe the species is only known from three Greek islands were only a small number of specimens were collected. Information on the actual size of these populations is lacking. In Turkey the species is generally found in low densities in relatively small habitats. It is therefore likely that the European populations are small to very small.,"The species is poorly known and there are no detailed accounts on the habitats where the species is found. The habitat is described as small and shallow, both standing and slowly running waters (Kalkman et al. 2004). The habitat where breeding is assumed is heavily vegetated with spike-rush (Eleocharis) and lesser water-parsnip (Berula erecta). In Hope (2007) it is stated that 'It is found in small muddy brooks and larger brooks'. Based on the above and unpublished records the habitat can best be described as brooks, small runnels and seepages with rich aquatic vegetation.","The reproduction sites occupied by the species are generally small and easily destroyed by agricultural practises and building activities. Climate change resulting in the desiccation of the habitats is the main present and future threat, which will affect the species over its whole range. Presently only three European localities are known for this species. Information on these sites is very poor but probably all of them are very small. All of these sites can probably be destroyed by a single small event such as the construction of a house, increased intake of water or a very dry year. In order to prevent this species from becoming extinct immediate action is needed.",The exact locality and status of the European populations are unknown and information on the habitat requirements of the species is scant. Habitat destruction can therefore easily cause the extinction of this species on any of the three islands where it occurs. The foremost conservation measure is therefore identifying the current locations and disclosing this information to the local authorities and conservation officers. Based on more adequate habitat information it must be seen if local conservation measures are possible to counterbalance the impact of climate change.Several records of unidentified specimens of Ceriagrion are known from Lesvos and from continental Greece. These localities should be revisited and the identity of the species should be confirmed.This species could easily become extinct in Europe in the next decade.

Mapping of the remaining populations followed by conservation action is needed in that part of Europe. On European scale the species is assessed as Least Concern.",Stable,"Over three-quarters of the distribution of Ceriagrion tenellum lies in Europe. The species is widespread in the western Mediterranean (including northwest Africa), extending into northwest Europe. Its most northern populations are found in the south of Great Britain, the Netherlands and western Germany. The species is widespread in Italy but is rare and local on the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea where it is found in a small coastal fringe in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania. It is absent from mainland Greece but is found on Crete and nearby Ios.The species is largely absent in a corridor running west to east in northern France and southern Belgium. This corridor splits the European area of the species in two. At least in the Netherlands and Flanders the species is showing a strong increase and is expanding its range. This is likely to happen in other parts of its northern range also and expansion of the species from northern France into the corridor is likely. Several records of unidentified specimens of Ceriagrion are known from Lesvos and from continental Greece and might belong to C. tenellum.","The species is generally widespread and populations are scattered and often found in small and localised waters. The species is often abundant when found and at least in the north of its range, where it is found in bogs, it often occurs in high densities.","As already remarked, the European distribution of the species is split in two by a corridor running west to east in northern France and southern Belgium where the species is largely absent. South of this corridor the species is mainly found at seepages, small brooks or seepage fed standing waters with rich aquatic vegetation although it is regionally also found in bogs (eg. Brittany and Haute-Saône). In the north of France the species is rare although suitable habitats seem to be present. This suggests that climatic conditions are here limiting the distribution of the species. The occurrence of the species further north seems to be facilitated by the use of a different type of habitat. In northern Belgium, the Netherlands, and adjacent Germany and in Great Britain the species is mainly found in bogs with Sphagnum. In this area the species has shown an increase in the last decade and the species is increasingly found in other types of habitats such as small brooks.","C. tenellum is in most of its range not threatened and there are no indications of a decline. The situation is different for the population in northern Italy and those on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. Here the species is limited to often small and isolated populations. It is likely that many of these have been impacted by habitat destructions due to agricultural practises and building activities. Moreover, these populations will likely be impacted by climate change. Prolonged dry and hot periods might result in desiccation of streams or the diminish of seepages.The populations in Baden-Württemberg (Germany) and Switzerland are relatively small and isolated. Most of these lie in nature reserves and there are no indications for a continuing decline.","In northern Italy and on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea the species can serve as indicator for habitat quality of brooks and seepages. The distribution of the species in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania should be carefully mapped and for each country an assessment should be made of the conservation status of the populations. Based on this, local measurements should be proposed and information should be disclosed to the local authorities and conservation officers.

The single German population (lake Zwingsee near Inzell, Bavaria) is now extinct due to habitat management and fish farming. The fragmented area of the species is attributed to post-glacial climate oscillations, the species having immigrated towards the west of Europe during the Atlantic period - post-glacial climatic optimum. Subsequent climate cooling coupled to high habitat specialization led to the fragmentation of the primary range of the species over large areas.","The species is known from 14 reproducing localities in Austria, but populations show very contrasting density from a place to another and from year to year.

EU 27 regional assessment: Vulnerable - VU B2ab(ii,iii,iv)Nehalennia speciosa has shown a strong and continuing decline in Europe. Although it disappeared from much of its European range and became isolated in many regions it still has a large range in northeast Europe. There are numerous populations in the eastern range of its distribution, for example in Russia, and the species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened at European level.In the European member states, it is estimated that the species has undergone a decline of around 30 % in the number of populations and sites, but most of this decline took place longer than 10 years ago and it is not suspected that this decline will continue in the next decade at such a high rate. The species is found at less than 1,000 very small sites in Europe and it is therefore assumed that the AOO is <2,000 km². The sites are severely fragmented and there is a noted decline in area of occupancy, area of habitat and the number of sites. For this reason the species is assessed as Vulnerable for the European member states.",Decreasing,"Nehalennia speciosa has a wide, partly fragmented, range from west Europe over northern Asia to Japan. The westernmost records are from Belgium and the Netherlands while in the north the species occurs to the southern parts of Sweden and Finland. Its southern limits are found in north Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, northern Romania and western and northern Ukraine. There are two old records known from the south of Ukraine: Crimea and Kherson (the latter seems to be doubtful) (Bernard and Wildermut 2005). The species has severely declined and went extinct in the Netherlands (last record 1912), Belgium (1960), Luxembourg (1960), Romania (1953), Slovakia (1960), and France (19th century). In most of the countries with recent records the species has declined and in several countries only isolated populations remain, e.g. Italy with five populations (T. Fiorenza and I. Pecile pers comm.) and Denmark with two populations.",At many localities suitable habitat is often of limited size and less than a few hectars large. The species however occurs often in high numbers and many populations count several hundreds to several thousand individuals.,"Nehalennia speciosa occurs in pools, bogs, fens and marshes and is most often found in shallow borders of acidic, nutrient-poor water bodies and wet depressions of bogs and fens. The habitat is largely unshaded but almost always lies in woodland of, in most cases, Pine (Pinus) or Spruce (Picea). The species is confined to specifically structured vegetation with uniform growth of narrow-leaved plants spaced densely enough to provide protection, but loosely enough to allow free movement. Slender Sedge (Carex lasiocarpa) and Bog-sedge (C. limosa) form at most European locations the dominant vegetation. Other plants, which can form a dominant part of the vegetation, include Beaked Sedge (C. rostrata), Tufted Sedge (C. elata), Purple Moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and Water Horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile). A crucial factor for the species microhabitat is the low depth of the water. This allows the water to warm up fast, favouring a fast development of the larvae, and makes the habitat unsuitable for predators like fish. N. speciosa is one of the few European dragonfly species that still mainly occur at primary (not altered by humans) habitats.",At many European localities the species went extinct due to habitat destruction caused by drainage and land reclamation. From the 1960s onwards pollution by nitrate became a dominant factor in the decline of the species. This resulted in the alteration of the vegetation due to which the needed vegetation structure disappeared. Pollution by nitrate is still an important factor but seems to have become less intensive. A relatively new factor is prolonged spells of hot and dry weather resulting in the desiccation of the habitats. Local threats are degradation of habitats by livestock and tourism.,"The species has a very specific habitat choice and a limited dispersal ability. Many of the remaining European localities are isolated and local extinction at these places will be definite. Actions to be undertaken for this species are:- Mapping the distribution of the remaining populations by checking all suitable locations. - Eliminating direct local threats like impact by livestock and tourism.- Downgrading the local impact of pollution by nitrate and desiccation. This can be done by creating forest surrounding the locality, which will shield areas from pollution by nitrate from adjacent farmland (but mind the impact on the hydrology).There is little experience with creating suitable habitat for this species. Given the specific habitat choice this is probably not easy. However a recent experiment with this in Niedersachsen in 2005 resulted in successful reproduction in 2008 (Clausnitzer 2009) showing that it is possible to create new habitats for the species. In areas where there are only small and isolated populations left, experiments like the one mentioned for Niedersachsen are needed in order to find ways to secure populations in the long term.This species is severely threatened in large parts of its northern European range and should be legally protected at European and national level where not in place already.","Kalkman, V.J."

It is especially common at waters with rich aquatic vegetation where the males can be seen perching on algal mats, hornworts (Ceratophyllum), water-milfoils (Myriophylum) and other plants.",The species is not considered threatened.,The species is common in large parts of its range and is expanding northwards. No conservation action is needed.,"Kalkman, V.J."
ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,ODONATA,COENAGRIONIDAE,Erythromma,najas,,,,,LC,,LC,,European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC). Erythromma najas is common in a large part of Europe and at the moment there are no indications of a decline. The species is assessed as being of Least Concern.,Stable,"Erythromma najas is a widespread species ranging from west Europe to Japan. Its main European range lies in Central and northeastern Europe where the species is common and widespread in the lowlands. It reaches north to the central parts of Fennoscandia. It becomes less common to the south of central Europe but is still fairly widespread in parts of southern France and the north of Italy. E. najas is absent from the Iberian Peninsula, very rare in Italy and known from scattered records in the Balkans only. The situation in Romania and the Ukraine is not clear but it is likely to be common in the north.","The species is common and often abundant in central and northeastern Europe. The density of populations is high in large parts of its range. In the south of its range populations are more scattered, smaller and often isolated.","Erythromma najas occurs at largely unshaded, standing or slow-flowing waters. Frequently, an important characteristic of the habitat is the presence of aquatic vegetation with floating leaves (Nuphar lutea, Nymphaea alba or Potamogeton natans). The species occurs in eutrophic as well as mesotrophic waters. In smaller abundance the species inhabits distrophic waters.",The species is not considered threatened in most of its range. It is however likely to be impacted by climate change in the south of its range. Drought and poor water management are the most important threats for highly isolated populations in the south. The only population in the south of Italy (Lago Monticchio) may be impacted by tourist developments as these two lakes are not in a pristine environment and are surrounded by a road.,In most of its range specific actions are not needed. The isolated populations in Italy and in the southern parts of the Balkans are threatened. It is advisable to map these populations in order to assess their conservation status.,"Kalkman, V.J."
ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,ODONATA,MACROMIIDAE,Macromia,splendens,,,Yes,Yes,VU,A4ce,VU,A4ce,"European regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU). EU 27 regional assessment: Vulnerable (VU). The species is endemic to Spain, Portugal and France. M. splendens apparently rapidly disappears when faced with water pollution, oxygen deficiency and introduction of non-indigenous crayfish, so a regular decrease in the number of occupied sites is expected in the future. In addition, the dramatic drought from which Iberia and Southern France now suffer repeatedly will inevitably lead to a reduction of the number of populations of 30% or more in this area during the next decade. The species is assessed as Vulnerable as it is expected to show a decline of 30% in the next ten years due to a continuing decline of the habitat quality. The species should be monitored and further surveys are required to confirm the full extent of its range.",Decreasing,"The species shows a disjunct distribution with the largest populations in southern France and northwest Iberia. Only single and old records are known from these two distribution centres. The whole area inhabited by this species reaches about 470,000 km². The two main distribution centres cover about 92,000 km² in France and 64,000 km² in northwest Spain (Galicia) and north Portugal.","The species has been reported with certainty from 14 departments in south and southwest France, but it is currently known only in 12 of these. Only in four departments it is not uncommon. In Iberia, flourishing populations are known in Galicia and north Portugal. In the rest of the western half of the Iberian Peninsula it is known from scattered and often isolated localities were it is found in low numbers. Macromia splendens is often difficult to find and is fairly rare. However, new findings (Chelmick 2006, Cordero Rivera 2000, Malkmus 2002, French INVOD inventory 2007) show that it is considerably less rare than previously believed.","It is found in streams and rivers at the slowly or nearly standing parts, even when induced by hydroelectric dams. Hydroelectric dams can support good populations when they are elongated and look like large rivers. The species is very scarcely reproducing in completely standing waterbodies.","Water pollution, drought and introduction of non-indigenous crayfish (J.-L. Dommanget pers. comm. 2008). The dramatic droughts of which Iberia now suffers repeatedly, that convert river barrage in lake-like habitats, will inevitably lead to the reduction of many populations in this area in the next decade. In addition, the introduction of exotic crayfish in the Tarn river in France led apparently to a significant decrease of the Macromia population during the last decade and this will probably continue in the future (J.-L. Dommanget pers. comm. 2008). Places where the species occurs are often favoured by tourists for swimming. A general degradation of water quality is noted almost everywhere throughout the species' range.",Necessary conservation measures include the control of water pollution and use by humans and the prevention of the introduction of non-indigenous crayfish. Establishments of nature reserves are recommended.,"Boudot, J.-P."

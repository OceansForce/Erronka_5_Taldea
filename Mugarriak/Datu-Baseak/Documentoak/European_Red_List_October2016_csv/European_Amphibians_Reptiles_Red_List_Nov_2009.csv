In the west of Spain and southern Portugal populations are affected by predation by non-native crayfish and predatory fish. Increasing urbanization surrounding Madrid has also led to the elimination of many populations. In southern and eastern Spain, over-exploitation of groundwater resources, agrochemical pollution, loss of traditional breeding sites and the introduction of predatory non-native fish and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) has led to a serious population decline. In Portugal this species is also affected by the drainage of temporary ponds, associated with the intensification of agriculture.","It is present in Parque Nacional de Cabañeros and Parque Nacional de Doñana, Spain, and is presumed to occur in some Portuguese protected areas.

There are introduced populations in the southeast United Kingdom (where the range is spreading), Switzerland, Belgium (Wallonia), Spain (Villasbuenas de Gata, Cáceres and unspecified localities in Galicia, Cataluña and Comunidad Valenciana), Siberia and Kamchatka, Russia and northwestern Xinjiang (Yining, Tacheng, Wenquan, Huocheng and Xinyuan), China. It is present throughout Turkey (although this might represent a separate taxon), possibly Syrian Arab Republic, much of Iran, northeastern Iraq and most of northern Afghanistan (absent from Pakistan). Isolated populations are present in Bahrain (it is not known as to whether or not this is an introduction) and within Saudi Arabia (relict populations in the southern Hadramaut, and an introduction at Al Kharj). Further investigations are needed into the range of the species within Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Numerous introductions have expanded the range in Siberia and Kamchatka. In Central Asia, it is often difficult to distinguish between the periphery of natural range and the areas occupied after dispersal and introductions. Numerous populations in Kazakhstan have originated through deliberate introductions from local laboratories and universities. The species was introduced into Siberia and Kamchatka through the accidental introduction of tadpoles with fish into reservoirs with warm discharge waters from electric power stations. It occurs from sea level to altitudes of around 2,500m asl.",This is generally a common to abundant species where it occurs.,"It is a highly opportunistic amphibian, living in mixed and deciduous forests, forest steppe, and steppe and other grasslands, semi-desert and desert zones. Arid areas are largely colonized through river valleys and channels. The frog prefers open, well-warmed areas with abundant herbaceous vegetation. It is a semi-aquatic species, inhabiting (and breeding in) a wide variety of flowing and stagnant water habitats, from shallow puddles and ponds to large lakes, reservoirs, rivers and brooks. It may also be found in slightly saline water; on the northern shore of the Apsheron Peninsula (Caspian Sea), reproduction has been observed in marine water at a distance of 0.5-1m from the shore. It is present in many modified habitats.","There are no major threats to this adaptable species. Loss of breeding habitats may lead to localized declines, but it is very resistant to environmental pollution and animals may be found in highly polluted waters (such as chemical or metallurgic pollution) where other amphibian species cannot survive. Severe, or prolonged, droughts may lead to localized population declines of this frog in arid areas. The harvesting of this species for educational and medical research, or food, appears to have little effect on some populations, although the frog-leg trade and high levels of pollution are leading to significant declines in populations in eastern Asia, in the former Yugoslavia (Dzukic, 1996; Ljubisavljevic et al. 2003) and possibly also in Romania. In Turkey, the harvesting of frog populations allocated to Pelophylax ridibunda for food appears to be a threat, thus the frog-leg trade and very significant levels of pollution due to some industrial areas might be leading to significant declines in populations in Turkey.","It is listed on Annex V of the EU Natural Habitats Directive and on Appendix III of the Berne Convention, and is protected by national legislation in a number of countries.

It has been introduced to the United Kingdom (one colony in Surrey). It is a lowland species that occurs from sea level up to a maximum of 730m asl (in western Bohemia).","This species remains fairly abundant over much of its range (for example it is extremely common to the north and west of the Danube floodplain where it has benefited from increased irrigation), although many northern populations have declined (e.g., in Poland and Germany). The populations of this species in both Denmark and Sweden are low. Individual populations of this species can show significant fluctuations in numbers. There are no recent records from Greece, but its range in this country has not been surveyed for many years. The species is common in parts of European Russia, Ukraine and Moldavia, and while it is unlikely to be declining on this territory in general, many local populations are declining.","Within Europe this species is associated with lowland areas of marshy or grassy wetlands, often along river valleys, with small, shallow, often-temporary lakes and ponds. In the former Soviet Union it has been reported from steppe, forest steppe, broad-leaved and mixed leafed coniferous forests, but it also inhabits open landscapes, using drainage channels as pathways for dispersal. At the southeastern margin of its distribution, the species lives in permanent freshwater bodies in river valleys surrounded by an arid saline landscape (solonetz-solonchak complex). It is primarily an aquatic animal living in shallow (less than 50-70cm depth) stagnant lakes, ponds, pools, swamps, peat bogs, ditches, flooded rice fields and quarries. It may occasionally be found in semi-flowing waters: springs, irrigation channels, rivers and stream pools and the water must generally be clear (for example in the Carpathian region, B. bombina lives in wetlands with clearer water than the congeneric Bombina variegata); however, near the southern margin of the range (such as southeastern Ukraine and the Krasnodar Region) the species often occurs in waters that have been polluted with industrial and agricultural chemicals such as settling and sedimentation reservoirs, rice fields, polluted ponds in rural and urban areas. The species breeds by larval development in pools with a good growth of sub-aquatic vegetation. Hybrid populations of this species with B. variegata have been recorded.","In western and northern Europe the species is threatened by the loss of habitat through modernisation of agricultural methods, most significantly the drainage and/or pollution of suitable wetland areas. Recent declines in northwestern Europe might also be related to climate change. In Turkey it is threatened by urban development and agricultural development. Within the former Soviet Union destruction of wetlands is also the most serious threat, although industrial pollution and recreational activities also impact populations. Additional localized threats to this species include mortality on roads, entrapment in open wells with vertical walls, hybridization and replacement by Bombina variegata and collection for the pet trade.

The pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been detected in reintroduced captive-bred populations, and it is plausible that severe population declines could take place in the future.",Increasing,"This species is restricted to the Sierra Tramuntana of northern Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. The present altitudinal range is from 10-850m asl. Its area of occupancy is less than 10km², but slowly increasing as a result of intensive conservation action.","The population is approximately 500-1,500 adult pairs (Gasc et al. 1997; Arnold 2003). There are approximately 25, mostly isolated, populations. The total population is slowly increasing following coordinated recovery efforts, following a long period of decline and near extinction. The current increase, which probably started around the time that the first re-introductions were made in 1989, has been maintained even during years of drought, notably in 1999-2000. The population trend in this species is monitored through annual tadpole counts, the counts for 2004 (over 30,000 tadpoles) being the highest on record. The increase in numbers in established populations is not dependent upon continued re-introductions. However, it is unlikely that new populations would be established without re-introductions.","It is currently found only in small streams deeply carved into limestone mountains. The presence of the species is positively associated with steep slopes. Breeding takes place in the small streams that persist as pools in summer. A few populations occur by man-made water sources (cattle troughs, containers, rain tanks etc.) in open mountainous country; these are within the river basins of nearby canyon-living populations. Animals are generally found in rock crevices and under stones. This species does not tolerate serious habitat degradation. The distribution of predators on the species is negatively associated with elevation, and reproductive success is positively associated with elevation.","The major threats are predation by the introduced Viperine Snake ( Natrix maura ), and competition for space with Perez's Frog ( Rana perezi ). Development of tourism and human settlements, specifically the increased need for water resources (including damming and canalization of streams), is an additional threat. The threats are not likely to decrease, and so the current recovery programme needs to be continued more or less indefinitely. One isolated re-introduced population was impacted by an unidentified non-fungal disease in 2002 which killed some tadpoles. This disease did not recur in 2003 and 2004. Chytridiomycosis has been identified in the wild population, with the source of this chytrid infection traced to reintroduced captive-bred animals from Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, UK (Walker et al . 2008).","The species is protected by sub-national and national legislation. It is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, on Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive, and on the national and sub-national Red Data Books. It is present in the protected areas of the Tramuntana mountains. The Balearic Government and Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust have undertaken captive-breeding, re-introduction and other conservation initiatives. At least 10 populations have been successfully reintroduced. Re-introductions of animals from the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust stopped in 2002, but a new captive-breeding facility now exists on Mallorca, and re-introductions are expected to resume. However, as a result of the recent discovery of disease, a recommendation was made in 2004 to the Balearic Government to halt the re-introduction programme. A new recovery programme for the species is now being developed. There is a need to closely monitor populations of this species, especially with regard to the recent detection of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in introduced animals (Walker et al . 2008). A systematic programme is in place to remove Natrix maura from the range of the species.","Joan Mayol Serra, Richard Griffiths, Jaime Bosch, Trevor Beebee, Benedikt Schmidt, Miguel Tejedo, Miguel Lizana, Iñigo Martínez-Solano, Alfredo Salvador, Mario García-París, Ernesto Recuero Gil, Jan Willem Arntzen"

Green toad populations from Sicily, Italy, now mostly comprise the endemic Pseudepidalea sicula , with some populations of Pseudepidalea balearica in the northeast of this island. The status of green toads in Israel, Jordan, Sinai (Egypt) and of the isolated, relict population in the southern Hadramaut in southwestern Saudi Arabia is currently unclear, and it is possible that these populations should be included within either Pseudepidalea variabilis or Pseudepidalea boulengeri pending further review.","This species is still considered a relatively abundant to common species over large parts of its range, although populations formerly recognized as Pseudepidalea viridis are rare or declining on the fringes of its range in Europe (e.g., Denmark and Sweden).

Its native range is from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, southern Quebec, Canada, south to eastern North America, except southern Florida, USA, then southward through Veracruz, Mexico. It is probably also found in other areas in Mexico (these are not shown on the map). This species was introduced to Mexico at the beginning of last century. It was introduced to 'La Garita' in Costa Rica, but now appears to be extinct in this country (Gerardo Chaves pers. comm.). It is also introduced in Cuba, Puerto Rico (introduced 1935), Hawaii (introduced mid- to late 1800s, now on all main islands), Isla de la Juventud, Hispaniola (only confirmed in northern and eastern Dominican Republic, not in Haiti) and Jamaica. Its range is increasing in some areas. It is introduced to South America, in Venezuela, there is an expanding population near La Azulita, in Mérida state, at the Andean versants facing Lake Maracaibo basin. In Colombia it is known from the Middle Magalena Valley, north to the lowlands on the Caribbean coast. In Peru it has become established around Iquitos in central Loreto Department in the Amazon Basin, and also around Lima on the Pacific coast. There are also a number of populations established in Ecuador and Brazil. In Europe, where it is introduced, the largest population occurs within the Po River Valley (Italy) where formal introductions continued at least until 1937. Other populations have been reported from Belgium (recorded from several sites in Wallonia and at least one population is known in Flanders), the Netherlands, central and southwestern France, Germany (in the vicinity of Bonn and also in Baden-Wuttemburg), Greece (Crete), Spain (Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands [only a few individuals observed and not mapped here], Villasbuenas de Gata in Cacerés [not recently observed and not mapped here] and Sierra de Collserola, Cataluña Province [only a few individuals observed and not mapped here]), northern and southern Italy (where it is naturalized in few localities in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Basilicata) and the United Kingdom (possibly now eradicated). It has possibly been introduced to Switzerland, although this requires further confirmation. In Asia, where it is also introduced, it is found in several localities in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand [not mapped here] and Singapore [not mapped here]. It has been introduced to mainland China and Taiwan, Province of China, for raising in farms for human consumption. Feral populations have become established in Taiwan, Province of China, Kunming in Yunnan province, Sichuan, Xinjiang and possibly other places in China as a result of escape or deliberate release. Individuals have been found in the wild in Hong Kong probably from releases of market animals. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this species is now established in Hong Kong. It is found widely from southern Hokkaido to Ishigakijima in Japan.","There are thousands of occurrences of this species. It is highly abundant and its global population is increasing. Although some of the populations in Europe of this species are increasing, other introductions not have become fully established. In Asia, it is only present in isolated pockets. Animals have been deliberately introduced to northern Thailand in the hope of augmenting native frog production. Farmed animals are exported alive to East Asia (Pariyanonth and Daorerk, 1995; Lim and Lim, 1992) and can escape or be released to become established. A growing population is now established in the Venezuelan Andes (C. Gottberg and A. Diaz pers. comm.), near the town of Jají, in Mérida State.","This species inhabits ponds, swamps, lakes, reservoirs, marshes, brackish ponds (in Hawaii), stream margins and irrigation ditches. It is sometimes found in temporary waters hundreds of metres from permanent water. It winters at the bottom of pools. It may disperse from water in wet weather. Eggs and larvae develop in permanent slow or non-flowing bodies of water.","There are no threats to this species. Outside its native range, this species is considered a pest. It has been observed predating on native species in Puerto Rico, including on Leptodactylus albilabris, and is a potential predator of other native species throughout its introduced range. It is a possible vector of pathogens.","There are no measures required to conserve this species. Instead, eradication of this species from its introduced range is a conservation priority. In Asia, this species is believed to have a negative impact on the native amphibian fauna. It should be monitored and controlled. Farming activities should concentrate on native Rana rugulosa. Farming of Rana catesbeiana should at least be strictly contained, including water discharges from farms that should be carefully controlled or prevented. Ideally, the farming of the species outside its range should be prohibited. Studies of actual and potential ecological impacts should be conducted, perhaps leading to an elimination programme. Awareness of the potential threat posed by this species to native biodiversity must be raised. The Venezuelan government has taken actions to avoid the spread of this species.

Animals feed on detritus and endemic cave invertebrates and hide in crevices or bottom sediment when disturbed. In contrast to the nominate subspecies, P. a. parkelj is found in warmer surface waters. The species is long-lived (they are not sexually mature until they are 12 years of age) and reproduce very slowly. Females lay approximately 70 individual eggs on the undersides of aquatic stones; however, in some cases the eggs are retained within the body and two fully formed young are produced.","The main threats to this species are changes to the forested and pastoral land above the subterranean systems, largely through tourism, economic changes, and increasing water pollution. These changes have a direct influence on the quality of the habitat available to the species. The species is highly dependent on clean water, and is therefore very susceptible to pollution.

It has only been found in seven mountain streams, all within the boundaries of El Montseny Natural Park (Carranza and Amat 2005). It is found between 700 and 1,200m asl.","Its population is thought to number between 1,000 and 1,500 mature individuals, with an estimated rate of decline of 15% over the last 10 years. Preliminary demographic studies have been carried out in two streams. In three streams Calotriton arnoldi occurs at very low densities and in one stream it is extinct above 1,000m asl. Populations are declining in the upper parts of all the streams as the water table is being lowered. The population of C. arnoldi is divided into two sub-populations that occur on each side of a river valley. These two sub-population groups are genetically and morphologically differentiated (Carranza and Amat, 2005).","It lives in oligotrophic, cold (below 15°C) fast running waters, preferentially in beech forest ( Fagus sylvatica ) but also in holm oak forest ( Quercus ilex ), with patches of Algnus glutinosa (Carranza and Amat 2005). Neither juvenile nor adult C. arnoldi have been found on land (Carranza and Amat 2005). If this behaviour is confirmed, the only way that contact among populations could occur is by moving down one watercourse and then up other tributaries of the same river system. It therefore seems possible that there is a considerable degree of isolation between the populations.","The drying out of mountain streams is the most immediate threat to this species. Large amounts of water are being extracted from El Montseny, and this is bottled and sold widely Spain and Europe. As a result, El Montseny is drying out and the distribution of Calotriton arnoldi is being reduced dramatically. The low population size of the species could also be due to past human alteration of its original habitat (Carranza and Amat 2005). The species might also be affected by global warming. For instance, the beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) forest, an excellent habitat for C. arnoldi , has shifted upwards by 70m at the highest altitudes (1,600–1,700m asl) since 1945, and is being replaced by holm oak ( Quecus ilex ) forest at lower altitudes (800–1400 m) (Peñuelas and Boada 2003). In other words, the most favoured woodland habitat of the species is moving up into areas where the streams are drying out.","It occurs in the El Montseny Natural Park, though this area is not managed to conserve this species. Research is needed to determine the species' ecological requirements, and to determine management options.

Following fish introductions, most populations rapidly become extinct (particularly alternative paedomorphic populations); some taxa (if taxonomy justified) have disappeared following fish introductions (e.g., M.a. lacustris : M. Denoël pers. comm.). In some areas there is over collection of the species for use in education and science (this has led to the extinction of the species from some Ukrainian localities). It is also collected in small numbers for the commercial pet trade (especially M.a. inexpectatus of Calabria). Populations in the Pelopenese and southeastern continental Greece are facing severe habitat loss. At least one of the introduced populations in the UK harbours chytridiomycosis, threatening native amphibian populations in the area.","This species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention. It is present in many protected areas, and protected by national legislation over much of its range. The species is recorded in a number of many national and sub national Red Data Books and Lists. New breeding sites for the species have been created in parts of its range (e.g., Hungary). Conservation measures needed include the removal of predatory fishes in mountain lakes, reduction of overgrazing in mountain pastures, and the restoration of traditional livestock troughs as breeding sites.

In southwestern Asia it occurs on the island of Cyprus, in southern Turkey (and as isolated populations in the Marmaraa region [Sindaco et al. 2000; Sindaco et al. 2006]), through the Levant region of western Syria, Lebanon, Israel and western Jordan, western and southwestern Saudi Arabia and northern Yemen. It can be found from sea level up to 1,850m asl.","It is a common species in most of its native range. In Spain, the species is most commonly found in densities of 10 to 25 animals per hectare, although up to 50 animals per hectare may be found. It is rare in Western Sahara. In Egypt, it is fairly common in coastal areas, but uncommon in more inland arid areas. In Turkey, it is uncommon (Avci and Kumlutaş, pers. comm. 2008).","It is a diurnal species found climbing in bushes in dry habitats. It inhabits shrubland, plantations, open pine woodland, orchards (such as almonds and olive groves) and gardens. In Egypt, it also occurs on vegetation in sparsely vegetated open gravel plains. The females produce a single clutch of between five and forty-five eggs per year, these are buried in the soil.","It is threatened locally by loss of habitat through urbanization and the development of tourist facilities, agricultural intensification, predation by domestic animals, accidental mortality on roads and by illegal collection of animals. It may be used for remedies or as a talisman in North Africa (not in Egypt). Animals are caught, sometimes illegally, for the international pet market and are offered to tourists at local markets. In Turkey, forest fires are also a threat.","It is listed on Annex II of the Bern Convention and on Appendix II of CITES. There is a need to protect the coastal habitat of this species. Its range includes many protected areas, for example the following ones in Morocco: Tamga, Saghro, Chekhar, Talassemtane, Trois fourches, Sebkha Bou Areg, Gourougou, Embouchure Moulouya, Béni Snassen, Jbel Moussa, Perdicaris, Bouhachem, Brikcha, Koudiat Tidighine, Lalla Outka, Lalla Chafia, Bou Iblane, Bou Naceur, Jbel Tichoukt, and Jaaba. There is a need to monitor and regulate the collection of animals in Egypt (S. Baha El Din pers. comm.). In Spain, barriers have been created in an attempt to prevent mortality on roads.","Milan Vogrin, Claudia Corti, Valentin Pérez Mellado, Paulo Sá-Sousa, Marc Cheylan, Juan Pleguezuelos, Sherif Baha El Din"

Good, stable populations of this species remain within the Caucasus.","This is a largely terrestrial species often found in clearings with lush vegetation, traditional meadows and glades within open broad-leaf woodland. In the Caucasus, the females lays four to eight eggs in a clutch between the middle of June and the middle of July (two clutches during the summer for Georgia and Armenia). The young hatch from August to September. This species goes to hibernation in October.","Populations in Central and Southern Europe (including Thrace) are significantly threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural intensification (conversion of suitable habitat; overgrazing; agrochemical pollution) (CoE, 2003). Threats to the species in the eastern part of its range are unclear, but are presumed to include habitat loss through agricultural intensification.",This species is listed on Annex III of the Bern Convention. It is present in protected areas in Serbia and Montenegro and in Greece.

Mainland populations and those on larger islands are more threatened, but the species tends to be more secure on small islands. It might be more common than is expected because it is easily overlooked.","This strictly nocturnal species is generally found in rocky areas, such as cliffs, boulders and stone walls in agricultural land. It largely avoids areas of maquis vegetation, woodland and urban environments (although it may be encountered in abandoned houses). The females lay two to three clutches of two eggs annually.","On Corsica and Sardinia it is locally threatened by habitat loss resulting from fires and urbanization. The threats to populations on the offshore islands of Tunisia are not known. The mainland Italian population at Genoa, and French mainland populations, are probably threatened. On small islands, populations can be threatened by the introduction of predators (e.g. domestic cats).","This species is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive.

It is also found in steppe habitat, sandy coastal areas, sparsely vegetated river plains, and on stone walls bordering party cultivated land (Anderson, 1999; Arnold, 2003). Animals often shelter under spiny shrubs and in burrows. In the south of its distribution, this species emerges from hibernation between the end of February and the beginning of March, and emerges in April in the montane and northern parts of its range. The female lays two clutches of between one and 12 eggs (usually three or four) (Arnold, 2003). The young hatch between the middle of May and the beginning of July. The species is reproductively mature following its first hibernation period.","In Romania, the species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation do sand dunes by reforestation, increased tourist, urban, agricultural and industrial development; pesticide pollution; overgrazing and inappropriate afforestation of suitable sandy habitat (CoE, 2003). The threats to populations outside of Europe needs further evaluation.","In view of the wide range of this species outside of Europe, it occurs in numerous protected areas across its range (most current populations are restricted to protected areas which conserve sand dunes).

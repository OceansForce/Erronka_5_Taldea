There is evidence of a subpopulation over 100 individuals in the Kraichgau region, Germany (Westrich 1996).","Andrena agilissima is a thermophilous species with preference towards warm biotopes. It is found on sandy areas, river banks, coastal grasslands, hollow ways, ruderal areas and field margins where Brassicaceae flowers are found. The species has one generation flying from late March to September (Osytshnjuk et al. 2005). This species is communal and nests in the crevices of sandstones and clay walls, outside house walls forming large aggregations (Rode 1962, Paxton et. al. 1999, Westrich 1996, Dylewska and Wisniowski 2003, Giovanetti et al. 1999, 2003). The females collect pollen mainly from Brassicaceae flowers (Sinapis, Brassica, Erysimum, Barbarea vulgaris), but also from Resedaceae (Reseda lutea), Asteraceae (Hieracium, Taraxacum), Saxifragaceae (Ribes) and Boraginaceae (Myosotis) (Kocourek 1966, Westrich 1996, Dylewska 1987, 2000, Osytshnjuk et al. 2005). It is also known that A. agilissima has a kleptoparasite, which is Nomada melathoracica (Westrich 1996).","The documented threats for this species are related to loss of suitable habitats, including appropriate nesting sites (e.g., vertical walls) and forage sites with Brassicaceae flowers. These two elements are important for the reproduction and survival of the species. In Germany, the species visits mainly wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis), which grows especially in unsprayed summer grain fields or in ruderal places (Westrich 1996). The species can survive and reproduce in areas where forage sites lie close to potential nesting sites. Intensive agricultural management of the landscape may remove potential nesting sites nearby the species' preferred foraging sites and this can threaten the species. It is able to forage up to five kilometres (Edwards and Williams 2004) and therefore, the presence of Cruciferous plants in its range is vital for the survival of the colonies. Due to the fact that the species may be found near to field crops, it may be affected by the use of chemical treatments.","This species is included in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of the following four European countries: Switzerland (Endangered; Amiet 1994), Germany (Vulnerable; Westrich et al. 2008), Netherlands (Near Threatened; Peeters et al. 2003) and Slovenia (Rare; Anonymous 2002). Andrena agilissima was found in protected areas as the Duna Drava National Park, Hungary (Jozan 1998).For conservation of local populations of Andrena agilissima in Germany, Westrich (1996) describes a few recommendations. These include the promotion of Cruciferous plants, preferred by this bee, in agricultural landscapes, through the creation of unsprayed border stripes, especially in summer grain fields to create a germination medium for species as wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis) which in Germany is of a great importance for A. agilissima and other bees. Another recommendation would be to let cultivated fields rest for one or two years in order to allow annual plants to regenerate naturally. The fields should be rotated or ploughed after one or two years, usually in early spring to promote wild mustard or late autumn to allow overwintering annuals to germinate. For the fields intensively used in the past, Westrich (1996) also recommends sowing wild mustard in the spring, adding other annual and biannual plant species preferred by wild bees and changing the site every one or two years.

The species is polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species, and females collect pollen from trees and shrubs of Rosaceae (Crataegus, Cerasus), Rhamnaceae (Rhamnus), Salicaceae (Salix) and Aceraceae (Acer). It nests in the soil solitary or in small aggregations (Osysthnjuk et al. 2008).","The species is affected by habitat loss as a result of an intensification of development, agriculture and forestry, and the stabilization of coastal landslips (Falk 1991). The decline in traditional land use has led to scrub encroachment and the loss of nesting and foraging sites. Whilst this species almost certainly requires spring flowering shrubs and trees for foraging, it also needs warm and sunny situations, which favour nesting. In woodlands, the shading out of rides and clearings is likely to prove deleterious. The communal nesting habits and much localized occurrence of A. bucephala at a site make it very easy to wipe out an entire population through indiscriminate disturbance.","This species is included in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of the following four European countries: Switzerland (Vulnerable; Amiet 1994), Czech Republic (Critically Endangered; Farkac et al. 2005), Germany (Vulnerable; Westrich et al. 2008) and Great Britain (Rare; Shirt 1987). It occurs in protected areas, such as Duna Drava National Park in Hungary (Jozan 1998).  Several management actions are proposed by Falk (1991). These include the maintenance of bare or sparsely vegetated soil, or short cropped vegetation, in warm sunny situations to favour nesting, where south facing banks and slopes may prove especially important. A reasonable amount of spring flowering shrubs and trees needs to be ensured, as well as the prevention of shrubs or coarse vegetation encroachment onto open habitats, by continuing any established management (e.g., grazing, cutting), or disturbance that contributes to the overall character and stability of the site. In woodlands, shading out of sunny rides and clearings should be prevented, maintaining the presence of sunny slopes or banks and spring flowering shrubs and trees.

In Asia it is recorded from Turkey, Republic of Dagestan, Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, western Siberia, China, Russian Far East, Japan, North and South Korea.","The current status of the European populations of this widely distributed but rare species remain unknown for most regions. In many countries of its range, Andrena taraxaci has not been collected over the last 10 years.","Andrena taraxaci inhabits different biotopes – natural, agricultural and urban - and it prefers meadows and slopes that are covered with Compositae plants. It is an oligolectic species, in that it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, specifically on Asteraceae suych as Cichorioideae (Radchenko and Pesenko 1994). It has aslo been recorded on Ranunculus, Potentilla, Prunus (Moczar and Warncke 1972), Salix (Scheuchl 1993a, Dylewska 2000) and Stellaria (Xu and Tadauchi 2002). The males of Andrena taraxaci are pollinators of Ophrys lutea through pseudocopulation (Oddone 2013). It is an early spring species that flies from March to May, and in the mountains until June. The females create large aggregations of nests in loosely planted clay soils (Kocourek 1966). Its nest parasites or kleptoparasites are Nomada integra Brullé, 1832 (Scheuchl 1993b), Nomada stigma Fabricius, 1804 (Dylewska 2000) and Nomada trispinosa Schmiedeknecht, 1882 (Kuntze and Noskiewicz 1938, Scheuchl 2000).","The main threats to this species are the sharp decrease of true steppes and other similar habitats, ploughing of fields where the species' nests are present, processing of fields with insecticides, and mowing and/or eating of flowering plants by domestic livestock at the time when adult bees begin to fly.","It is included in the Red List of Poland (Vulnerable; Banaszak 2002) and Germany (Very Rare; Westrich et al. 2011). The species occurs in protected areas and has been recorded in many nature reserves in a number of European countries. Further research should be conducted to determine the population size, trends and specific threats to the species. In order to protect the species, it would be useful to prohibit: the grazing, cutting or burning of flowering plants in the locality of the bee; the use of insecticides; and the ploughing of agricultural land on which the species builds its nests.","This species is not traded or exploited commercially, but it is valued as a pollinator of Asteraceae plants.","Radchenko, V.","Scheuchl, E., Kemp, J.R. & García, M.",

It is rare, threatened or extinct in the National Red Lists of seven countries. Further surveys are necessary in order to establish the actual status of this species throughout its range, based on new updated data recorded from field research.",Unknown,"Andrena tarsata is distributed from Europe (except the extreme south) to the Caucasus Region (Azerbaijan, Georgia), Asia Minor, Central Asia (Kazakhstan), Siberia, far-eastern Russia, Mongolia and China (Gusenleitner and Schwarz 2002, Kuhlmann et al. 2012, Rasmont et al. 2013, Ascher and Pickering 2014).","The populations are small, but there is no information available on the population trend of this species.","Andrena tarsata is found primarily in moist habitats such as mesophilous meadows and forest glades. In the mountains it can be found at altitudes up to 2,000 m asl. It is a summer species, flying from June to early September with its peak early in August depending on its latitude or altitude location. In central Europe, it is mentioned from sandy heathland areas with sparse grasslands (Peeters and Reemer 2003). In England, the species nests in sparsely vegetated sand and peats on heaths and moorlands (Fowles 1996).  It is considered oligolectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, specifically on Potentilla species (Potentilla cinerea, P. erecta, P. fruticosa) (Peeters and Reemer 2003), but it is also found on Orobanchaceae (Melampyrum nemorosum) (Osytshnjuk 1977). In Finland, it has been recorded on the flowers of 12 species (Elfving 1968), in the former Czechoslovakia it was recorded visiting flowers of many species from different families (Kocourek 1966), and in England pollen was found from the females of Potentilla erecta and Spirea ulmaria (Chambers 1968). The males have been found on Crataegus sp. and Calluna sp. (Dylewska and Bąk 2005, Warncke 1981). Its nest parasites are Nomada obtusifrons and N. tormentillae (Stöckhert 1933, Kocourek 1966).","Despite the species being widespread, in England the sites where this bee has been recorded have dropped by around 50% since 1970 (JNCC 2010).  The primary explanation for the decline of A. tarsata in central Europe is likely to be loss, fragmentation and degradation of the heathland and moorland habitats that it is found on and, as a consequence, its crucial food plant Potentilla may have declined. This can be linked to the widespread and rapid intensification of agricultural practices and urban and industrial development that has taken place in the last 60 years.  In upland habitats, afforestation and changes in grazing pressure are important drivers of habitat loss. On lowland heathland, there are a variety of pressures, including afforestation, mineral extraction, urban development, and the growth of scrub.  Research has also shown that even at some sites where there are large stands of Potentilla, the bee is often absent. This may be a reflection of the heathland and moorland deterioration seen over the last couple of decades (JNCC 2010).","This species is included in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of the following seven European countries: the Czech Republic (Critically Endangered; Farkac et al. 2005), Germany (Endangered; Westrich et al. 2008), Great Britain (Rare; Falk 1991), Hungary (Regionally Extinct; Józan 2011), Netherlands (Critically Endangered; Peeters and Reemer 2003), Poland (Vulnerable; Banaszak 2002) and Slovenia (Rare; Anonymous 2002). It occurs in protected areas such as the Mercantour National Park in France (Schmid-Egger 2011).  Andrena tarsata is on the England Biodiversity Strategy S41 Species List 1 (previously the UK List of Priority Species and Habitats under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP)). The potential strategies to conserve A. tarsata and consequently, its regionally endangered cuckoo bee Nomada roberjeotiana in the UK can be found in Evans and Potts (2013). The local authorities should record any important sites (either already in existence or identified by further survey work) for the bee in their local plans and ensure policies and mitigation plans are then in place to protect these populations. In Yorkshire, a local recorder noticed that there was planning permission to test drill for minerals 10 ft from a nesting aggregation of A. tarsata and, after raising awareness of the bee and some persuasion, permission to drill was then refused for most of the flight period of the bee.  UK Government and local authorities need to encourage developers to include bee-friendly habitats in new developments. This would be in-line with the National Planning Policy Framework which aims to achieve biodiversity gain.  Local people in the region could also join local habitat creation campaigns such as Friends of the Earth ‘Bee Worlds’ project and also sign their petition for a Bee Action Plan.Andrena tarsata has been recorded on Potentilla fruticosa in Norway, where it is widely planted as an amenity plant. In order to provide extra forage, local authorities, members of the public and wildlife reserve managers should plant Potentilla fruticosa in towns adjacent to sites at which the bee is found.", This species is not traded or exploited commercially.,"Tomozii, B. & Radchenko, V.","Scheuchl, E., Kemp, J.R. & García, M.",

The species will nest in bare ground in loess or clay soils, and in aggregations numbering over 100 nests. It is eusocial, and the gynes (the primary reproductive female caste of social insects) can live for up to five to six years. In the first year, the gynes raise a few workers (two to six). These long-lived workers then assist the gyne in enlarging the nest and in pollen foraging. The second season will raise further workers (up to 18).

Outside of Europe it is found in the southern part of the Caucasus and Kazakhstan.The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 300 km2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) is 8 km2.,"Populations of Andrena ornata in Crimea are very small and within the last 30 years it is only known from three localities, within 5 km2. It is a rare species and only a few specimens per year are found so there is little information available on the population trend of this species. In the neighbouring regions of Crimea this species has not been found, despite a systematic search for it. Even if rediscovered in Russia, the population will still be severely fragmented, allowing no genetic exchange or recolonisation.The information about current population status in other territories of Europe is absent. This species was last found in Russia more than 50 years ago (Nikiforuk 1957).","This steppe species occurs in different habitats, but prefers xeric ones (Osytshnjuk et al. 2008). In Crimea this species is associated with the open steppe grasslands, especially with the flowers of Crinitaria villosa (Asteraceae). In other regions it also forages on Salicaceae, Brassicaceae, Rosaceae, Geraniaceae, Apiaceace, Valerianacecae and Ranunculus species. Based on the data of collection materials from different regions of Europe, it can be assumed that Andrena ornata has two generations per year (V. Radchenko pers. comm. 2013). The first generation of this species flies from May to June, and the second from late July to early September. The nesting of this species is unknown.","A decrease in the population of this species can be connected with the decrease in the number of steppe plants. In the southern steppe regions of Ukraine and Russia the rainfall has started to increase in the past decade. This has caused the steppes to turn into meadows due to increased succession and even become overgrown with shrubs and trees, therefore reducing the amount of suitable habitats for this species (V. Radchenko pers. comm. 2013).","This species is listed in the Red Data Book of the Ukraine as Rare (Radchenko and Ivanov 2009). In Crimea, it occurs within the protected area, Kazantip Nature Reserve. For the conservation of this species new nature reserves should be created and the plants it feeds upon, and thus pollinates, should also be protected. Research should be conducted into the population status and trends for this species.","This species is not traded or exploited commercially, but is valued as a pollinator of steppe plants.","Kemp, J.R., Michez, D., Nieto, A., Patiny, S., Radchenko, V. & Roberts, S.","Scheuchl, E. & Scott, J.A.",

It has also been recorded once from the USA, Illinois, Champaign, Tolono (GBIF 2014).","Andrena ovatula populations in most European countries might be decreasing, although this is only estimated from the amount of specimens in different collections over the past 10 years. This species is suspected to have declined by around 30% (V. Radchenko pers. comm. 2014), and this also follows from the estimates of the amount of collected specimens in the different European collections over the past 10 years. A particularly strong decline in the number is observed in the northern regions of Europe. For example, it is included in the Red list of Netherlands as Vulnerable (Peeters and Reemer 2003; De rode lijst 2012) and in the Red List of Finland as Regionally Extinct (Rassi et al. 2010).","Andrena ovatula inhabits many different biotopes, both natural and cultural, and it is found on flower-rich grasslands, as well as heathlands. It is polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species, but with a large preference for flowers of leguminous plants in all parts of its range. However many specialists consider this species as oligolectic, i.e., it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, specifically on leguminous plants (Stöckhert 1933, Pittioni and Schmidt 1943, Ponomareva 1960, Kocourek 1966, Warncke 1966a, Popov 1967a, Pesenko 1972, Osytshnjuk 1977, Westrich 1989, Radchenko and Pesenko 1994). In reality, females also collect pollen from the flowers of other different plants, including species of the following families: Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae, Ranunculaceae, Lamiaceae, Boraginaceae and Scrophulariaceae. It flies from March until September, and has two generations per year.This species builds nests in the ground, including fields, and they create aggregations, sometimes numbering up to several thousand nests (Wafa et al. 1972). In some places the density of nests can reach up to 100 per square metre. However, in most parts of Europe, they settle in very small aggregations or alone. Each nest consists of a main burrow (length of about 20 cm) and lateral burrows at the end of which is located a single cell. Inside the cell, the female stores a spherical pollen loaf, on which she lays a single egg. The cell walls are coated with a moisture-resistant secretary waxy substance that is produced from Dufour gland. Its nest can be parasitized by the kleptoparasitic bee, Nomada rhenana (Stöckhert 1933, Popov 1967a).",The main threats to the species are the ploughing and the application of pesticides and insecticides to fields on which the species build their nests. The mowing of flowering plants during the time in which adult bees forage is also a threat to the species' access to nutrients.,"This species is included in the Red List of Finland (Regionally Extinct; Rassi et al. 2010), Ireland (Data Deficient; Fitzpatrick et al. 2006), the Netherlands (Vulnerable; Peeters and Reemer 2003), Germany (Least Concern; Westrich et al. 1998, 2008, 2011) and the Free State of Saxony (Endangered; Burger et al. 2004). The species occurs in protected areas and has been recorded at many Nature Reserves in most European countries. Further research is required to confirm the population size and trends of this species.As the species is useful for the pollination of crops that honey bees do not pollinate, such as alfalfa, it is necessary to preserve the plants during their flowering, prohibiting the use of insecticides on the fields during flowering and avoiding ploughing the fields immediately after their use in order to protect the species. There are are a number of techniques that can be used to increase the species on alfalfa fields (see Radchenko 1982, Pesenko and Radchenko 1993).","In most regions of the Palaearctic this species is one of the main pollinators of leguminous plants, especially alfalfa, which are not pollinated by honey bees (Popov 1956, Pesenko and Radchenko 1994).","Radchenko, V.","Kemp, J.R., Scheuchl, E. & García, M.",

The species has experienced a strong long-term decline and a moderate short-term decline in Germany (Westrich et al. 2011). The main reason for the decrease in the number of populations is associated with the sharp reduction in the area of habitats in which the species can live. At the same time, the reduced abundance of its major food plants, Apiaceae species, with which the species is trophically associated, can be related to potential declines in this species. In other countries within its range, this species is known to be very rare.","Andrena pallitarsis inhabits different biotopes, but predominantly xerophytic areas such as steppes, mountain slopes, wastelands or brownfield sites and other places where its host plants are flowering. It is oligolectic, in that it prefers to forage on a narrow range of flowering plant species, specifically upon the flowers of Apiaceae species (Warncke 1981, Gogala 1999). In particular, Andrena pallitarsis was recorded on the flowers of Bupleurum falcatum (Lukáš et al. 1999), Libanotis intermedia, Pimpinella saxifraga, Ferula songorica, Ferula tatarica, Chaerophyllum proscottii, Libanotis montana and Falcaria rivini (data from the collection of Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St-Petersburg). However, this species also sporadically occurs on Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbia virgata), Asteraceae (Carduus acanthoides) and Lamiaceae (Stachys palustris) (unpublished data Osytshnjuk, V.

The species is parasitised by Nomada errans, which lay their eggs in the cells of Andrena pallitarsis (Celary 1995).","The main threats to this species include the ploughing of fields, the application of insecticides and pesticides to the fields on which they build their nests, and grazing pressure from domestic livestock on flowering plants during the time when adult bees forage.","The species is listed in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of the Czech Republic (Endangered; Farkac et al. 2005), Germany (Critically Endangered; Westrich et al. 2011) and Switzerland (Endangered; Amiet 1994).

It is listed as Least Concern in the National Red Lists of Poland (Banaszak 2002; Wiśniowski and Werstak 2009) and the Czech Republic (Bogusch 2014), and not included as threatened in Slovenia (Anonymous 2002) or Slovakia (Lukáš 2001, Farkac et al. 2005), despite its obvious presence. The relative stability of Andrena pandellei is associated with the fact that this species is able to forage upon a broad number of plant species and is not so reliant on bluebells, although they are the species' preferred food source.","Andrena pandellei inhabits different biotopes but prefers moist forested areas including mountain meadows, forest edges and glades. It also occurs on dry meadow slopes. In the mountains it was recorded at altitudes between 1,400-1,600 m asl (Osytshnjuk 1977, Osytshnjuk et al. 2008). In most parts of its area this species flies from the end of April until the end of June. It is oligolectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, and it is associated with bluebells (Campanulaceae; Westrich 1989, Radchenko and Pesenko 1994) such as Campanula patula, C. rapunculoides and C. sibirica. However, sometimes the females visit flowers of the Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Serophulariaceae, Rosaceae and Brassicaecae (Kocourek 1966) so perhaps the species is broadly oligolectic. The relative stability of Andrena pandellei populations could be associated with the fact that this species is not so closely linked with bluebells and can therefore survive in the absence of such flowers. The males of Andrena pandellei have been recorded pollinating Ophrys sphegodes (Orchidaceae) by pseudocopulation (Devillers and Devillers-Terschuren 2004). It nests primarily on clay soils, forming the small aggregations, although Kocourek (1966) observed a colony, numbering more than 100 nests. The nests are parasitized by Nomada braunsiana Schmiedeknecht, 1882 (Stöckhert 1933).","The main threats to this species comes from the ploughing of fields, the application of insecticides and pesticides to the fields on which they builds their nests and grazing pressure from domestic livestock on flowering plants during the time when adult bees forage. Of particular importance is the overgrazing of dry slopes that leads to the disappearance of bluebell meadows that usually appear in mid-May.","In order to protect the species, it is necessary to preserve the bluebells that they feed upon, prohibit the use of insecticides and pesticides during the flowering of these bluebells, and prevent grazing from livestock upon bluebells. The species occurs in protected areas and has been recorded at nature reserves in some European countries.

The main cause of the decline is the sharp reduction in the area of habitats in which this rare species can reside. The abundance of bluebells, its major food source, has also decreased throughout Europe.","Andrena paucisquama inhabits a variety biotopes, such as meadows, forests, grasslands, semi-deserts and rocky areas, sub-alpine and alpine mountain zones, although it prefers the forest edge habitats. In southern Europe, it lives in man-made forests and ravine forests, especially near bluebells with which it is trophically related. It is oligolectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, and the females collect pollen from different species of Campanulaceae. The males and young females spend the night inside the flowers of these plants (usually in Campanula sp.). However, it has been occasionally observed on the flowers of other plants: Rosaceae (Potentilla pimpinelloides), Geraniaceae (Geranium sp.), Plantaginaceae (Veronica sp.), Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbia semivillosa), Asteraceae (Inula hirta), Fabaceae (Trifolium europaeus), Brassicaceae (Bunias orientalis), Ranunculaceae (Ranunculus repens) (Osytshnjuk 1977, Radchenko 1982, Kuznetsova 1990). The males of Andrena paucisquama have been recorded as a pollinator of Ophrys aesculapii (Orchidaceae) through pseudocopulation (Paulus 2001). In most parts of its area, this species flies from May until June. The nesting behaviour is unknown.","The main threats to this species come from the ploughing of land in which the species builds its nests, the use of insecticides and pesticides on fields, and overgrazing of bluebells by domestic livestock during the time when the adult bees forage. According to Ebmer (2009), females could not be found because small-flowered bluebell meadows had disappeared in mid-May due to the overgrazing of this habitat. The loss of the species' habitat and preferred food source are thought to be causing the species to decline throughout Europe.","Andrena paucisquama is listed in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of Poland (Vulnerable; Witkowski et al. 2003), the Czech Republic (Endangered; Farkač et al. 2005) and Germany (Endangered; Westrich et al. 2011).

Andrena pilipes is found throughout Europe (except the northern regions of Sweden, the United Kingdom and European Russia) (Stöckhert 1933, Popov 1967a, Warncke 1976, Osytshnjuk 1977). It is also found in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya) (Warncke 1967a, 1967b), Asia Minor (Warncke 1969a, 1974b), Israel, Jordan (Grace 2010), the Caucasus region (Bogachev 1951, Aliyev 2013), Kazakhstan (Tadauchi 2008), Central Asia (Popov 1967a), Iran (Radoszkowski 1871), Afghanistan (Warncke 1973b, Dunford et al. 2014), Siberia (Sidorov 2010), the Far East of Russia, Mongolia, China, Japan (Yasumatsu 1941, Wu 1965, Osytshnjuk 1995), India and Pakistan (Tadauchi 2008, Xu and Tadauchi 2011). It has been found in North America (USA - Illinois, Champaign, Tolono - GBIF 2014).  In addition, this species was indicated in Finland (Vikberg 1986), where it was included in the National Red List as Endangered (Rassi et al. 2001), while the actual species occurring in Finland is Andrena nigrospina, which is considered here as a separate species (Rassi et al. 2010).","The populations of Andrena pilipes in most European countries are stable, apart from the northern parts of its range in Europe where this species is very rare and even decreasing in abundance.","Andrena pilipes is an ubiquitous species, found in urban and rural, wet and dry regions but it rarely occurs in mountainous regions of the temperate zone. In the southern part of Asia it is found in the high mountains, as in Kyrgyzstan at an altitude of 2,240 m asl (Tadauchi 2008) and up to 5,000 m asl in India (Ascher and Pickering 2013). The species flies from April to August and has two generations per year. It is widely polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species (Popov 1967a, Osytshnjuk 1977, Pesenko et al. 1982, Beil et al. 2008). For example, in Ukraine the females visit flowers of more than 50 plant species from 19 families. It is known as one of the main pollinators of different fruit and pumpkin crops (Filov 1935, Nevkryta 1950, Rymashevskiy and Rymashevskaya 1958, Rasulov 1966). The males pollinate different species of Orchids (especially Ophrys exaltata, O. garganica and O. sphegodes) through pseudocopulation (Xu et al. 2012). It nests in different soils and creates relatively large aggregations of nests (Nevinson 1902). The main burrow of the nest is meandering and descends almost vertically down to a depth of 20 cm where there are several cells, one behind the other in a plane, parallel to the ground surface. The inner walls of cells are covered with wax-like lining. Inside the cell the female lays one egg on the pollen ball (Marikovskaya 1972). The nest is parasitised by Nomada fulvicornis (Stöckhert 1933).","The main threats to this species are the ploughing of fields on which it builds its nests, the processing of the fields with insecticides and pesticides, and the mowing of flowering plants during the time when adult bees forage. In some areas, where this species was once widely distributed, its habitat has been extensively modified and reduced, and therefore the species is no longer seen in the regions (Ronayne 2006).","To protect the species, as it is an important pollinator of fruits and crops, it is necessary to preserve wild plants during their flowering period and to prohibit the use of insecticides and pesticides on fields when wild plants are flowering. Andrena pilipes has been recorded from many protected areas in many European countries.

It is likely that the distribution of this species is much wider, since it may have been misidentified with Andrena dorsata.","The current status of Andrena propinqua populations in most European countries is unclear due to the fact that in many articles this species is considered as a synonym of Andrena dorsata. However, in all regions where it is listed as a separate species, it appears to be stable, but it seems less present than Andrena dorsata.","Andrena propinqua inhabits different biotopes, both natural and agricultural, such as field crops, gardens, shelterbelts, forest edges and dry meadows. It is rarely found in the steppe zone and it is even rarer to find in mountainous areas. It flies from April to August and has two generations. It is polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plant species, with females visiting flower of plants from 11 families, but mostly recorded on the flowers of Brassicaceae and Rosaceae (Osytshnjuk 1977, Radchenko 1982, Kuznetsova 1990). It is a pollinator of fruit crops (Muzichenko 1937, Nevkryta 1957, Breitbach et al. 2012), some cultivated plants of Brassicaceae and alfalfa (Wu 1960, Kocourek 1966). Its nest parasite is Nomada zonata Panz. (Kocourek 1966).","The main threats to this species are the sharp decrease of true steppes and other similar habitats, ploughing of fields where the nests are present, processing of fields with insecticides, and mowing and/or eating of flowering plants by domestic livestock at the time when adult bees begin to fly.","This species is not listed in any National Red Lists or Red Data Books. However, it is listed in the regional Red Lists of different states of Germany. In particular, it is listed as Extinct in the Schleswig-Holsteins state (van der Smissen 2001) and as Critically Endangered in the Thuringia state (Burger 2011). It is has a lower threat category in some other states where it is distributed (Burger and Winter 2001, Mandery et al. 2003, Burger et al. 2004). It is unknown whether it occurs in protected areas. Further research should be conducted to determine the taxonomy, distribution, population size, trends and specific threats to the species.In order to protect the species, its preferred wild plants need to be preserved by prohibiting the use of insecticides on the fields during flowering and by preventing livestock from grazing on the flowering plants.","This species is not traded or exploited commercially, but is valued as a pollinator of different plants.

If Andrena proxima was to retain its current taxonomic status then it would have a wide ranging and possibly stable population. However, if the species is split into several distinct species then it would be necessary to re-examine all previous records of this species to know the appropriate occurrence of each new species.","Andrena proxima occurs mainly in moist habitats, meadows, forest edges and clearings, and alpine and sub-alpine meadows. In the Alps, it is found at altitudes up to 2,000 m asl (Frey-Gessner 1911). It settles mostly on grasslands, but also on other warm, dry, and open sites. It nests either on its own or in small aggregations, generally avoiding sandy soils (Kocourek 1966, Westrich 1989). Its kleptoparasite, or nest parasite, is Nomada conjungens (Friese 1926).Andrena proxima is oligolectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, such as the flowers of Apiaceae from which it gathers pollen and nectar (Friese 1926, Kocourek 1966, Warncke 1966a, 1981, Osytschnjuk 1977, Howe 2002). It also visits flowers of Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Campanulaceae and Euphorbaceae, but only rarely. It is univoltine (it has one generation per year) and it flies from mid-April until late June.","The main threats to this species are the ploughing of land on which the species builds its nests, the processing of fields with insecticides, and the mowing and/or eating of flowering plants by domestic livestock when adult bees begin to fly. Any potential population declines may be attributable to the deterioration of habitats rich in umbellifers (Apiacaea). In different sites, this may be due to urbanisation, or agricultural and forestry intensification.","In order to conserve this species, the species' preferred plants need to be preserved by prohibiting the use of insecticides on the fields during flowering, preventing the ploughing of lands on which the species builds its nests, and by preventing livestock from grazing on the flowering plants.   The species occurs in protected areas and has been recorded at many nature reserves in European countries. If we assume that for central European countries that the species has been correctly identified then the species is only listed as Vulnerable in the Red List of Great Britain (Shirt 1987). Elsewhere it is classified as Least Concern for Poland (Banaszak 2002), the Netherlands (Peeters and Reemer 2003) and Germany (Westrich et al. 2011).Further research should be conducted to determine whether the taxonomy of this species should remain the same or if the species should be split into a number of separate species. Additional research would then be required to determine the correct distribution, population, habitat, ecology and threats to the species.","The species is not traded or exploited commercially, but is valued as a pollinator of Apiaceae.","Radchenko, V.","Scheuchl, E., Kemp, J.R. & García, M.","Roberts, S."

Here we accept this species from Gusenleitner and Schwarz (2002) with the inclusion of Andrena pseudasuniensis as a junior synonym of Andrena pusilla.   From such a viewpoint, Andrena pusilla is a central-European species that is distributed in Albania (Warncke 1966b); Austria (only in Burgenland, Styria, Upper Austria and Salzburg states - Schwartz et al. 1996, Gusenleitner 1984); Belgium (Rasmont et al. 1995); Bosnia and Herzegovina (Warncke 1966b); Croatia (Gusenleitner and Schwarz 2002; but it is absent in the checklists by Jozan (2009, 2014)); Czech Republic (Bohemia and Moravia; Přidal 2004, Straka et al. 2007, Dvořák et al. 2007); France (mainland and Corsica - Warncke et al. 1974, Rasmont et al. 1995, Chifflet et al. 2011); Germany (mostly in southern part: Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Wesyphalia, Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Saxony-Anhalt States - Schmid-Egger et al. 1995, Dathe et al. 1995, Schmid-Egger and Scheuchl 1997, Burger and Winter 2001); Greece (only Continental Greece - Warncke 1966b, Grace 2010); Hungary (only in Great Hungarian Plain, Transdanubian Hills and Transdanubian Mountains - Moczar and Warncke 1972, Józan 2011); Italy (mainland, Sicily and Sardinia - Strand 1921, Comba and Comba 1991, Pagliano 1995, Quaranta et al. 2004); Luxembourg (Rasmont et al. 1995); Netherlands (Peeters et al. 1999, Peeters and Reemer 2003, Koel 2014, Raemakers et al. 2004); Poland (Dylewska 2000, Banaszak 2000); Romania (Warncke and Scobiola-Palade 1980); Slovakia (Přidal 2004) and formally Switzerland, now extinct (only Jura and Mittelland West states - Rasmont et al. 1995; Schwartz et al. 1996).  The records of Andrena pusilla from the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) must be re-examined and confirmed in new investigations (Dardón et al. 2010). This undoubtedly applies to the recent indications of Andrena pusilla for Spain that were examined by Ortiz-Sánchez (2011).  The species has also been recorded in Asia and north  Africa.","It is necessary to re-examine most occurrences of this species due to the associated taxonomic problems, therefore the current status of the Andrena pusilla populations are unknown.","Andrena pusiila inhabits different biotopes, both natural and cultural, and it is found on flower-rich grasslands, as well as heathlands. It is a bivoltine species, in that it has two generations. The first generation flies from April to May, while the second generation flies from July to August (Dardón 2010).

Radchenko pers. comm. 2014).It is suspected that there has been at least a 30% continuing decline in the species' AOO, EOO and habitat quality across Europe. Only Turkey has a population that could be considered stable.","Andrena transitoria is a steppic species occurring only in dry habitats. In the Caucasus mountains, it rises up to a height of 800 m asl. In the far south of its range, it is predominantly found in the mountains. It is a bivoltine species (it has two generations per year) that flies from April until August. It is a polylectic bee, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species. It visits the flowers of plants from 11 families: Brassicaceae (Barbarea vulgaris, Sinapis arvensis, Lepidium draba, Erucastrum armoracioides, Crambe tataria, Sisymbrium orientale, Berteroa incana, etc.), Asteraceae (Xeranthemum annuum, Coreopsis grandiflora), Labiatae (Salvia nemorosa), Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbia), Fabaceae (Robinia pseudoacacia), Papaveraceae (Papaver rhoeas), Limoniaceae (Limonium), Apiaceae (Eryngium campestre, Aegopodium podagraria, Falcaria, Daucus, Anthriscus, etc.), Boraginaceae (Cynoglossum), Lythraceae (Lythrum salicaria) and Campanulaceae (Campanula rapunculoides) (Osytshnjuk 1977, Radchenko 1982, Dylewska 2000), but it is thought to prefer Brassicaceae, Asteraceae and Apiaceae. In Greece, the males of Andrena transitoria have been recorded as pollinators of Ophrys melena through pseudocopulation (Paulus and Salkowski 2007).",The main threats to this species are: the sharp decrease of true steppes and other similar habitats; the ploughing of fields where the species nests; the processing of fields with insecticides; and mowing and/or eating of flowering plants by domestic livestock at the time when adult bees begin to fly.,"In order to protect the species, it is necessary to preserve the wild plants that they feed upon and prohibit the use of insecticides, pesticides, grazing, cutting or burning during the flowering of the wild plants. The species is listed as Extinct in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of the Czech Republic (Farkac et al. 2005) and Hungary (Józan 2011). It occurs within protected areas. Further research should be conducted to determine the population size, trends and specific threats to the species.","This species is not traded or exploited commercially, but is valued as a pollinator of different plant species.","Radchenko, V.","Scheuchl, E., Kemp, J.R. & García, M.",

ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,HYMENOPTERA,APIDAE,Apis,mellifera,,,,0,0,DD,,DD,,"European regional assessment: Data Deficient (DD) EU 27 regional assessment: Data Deficient (DD)The species is known to have a native distribution throughout much of Europe, except Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, the Azores, and northern Scandinavia, with numerous subspecies described across its range in Europe. However, it is not known whether or not the species currently still occurs in the wild, due to the introgression of managed and feral colonies with wild colonies and the fact that the wild population may not be self-sustaining. The impact of threats such as the transfer of pathogens and parasites from managed and feral colonies to wild colonies, detrimental bee-keeping practices, loss of forage and nesting habitat, invasive alien species, the lack of pest control, and other anthropogenic impacts such as the use of agrochemicals may have resulted in the loss of the wild population.   Some colonies that are found in the wild e.g., in tree cavities, may have escaped from a managed colony and therefore they may not be wild and may not survive to reproduce; therefore it is unlikely that there are any truly wild subpopulations left in Europe due to this gene flow.It is important to state that the managed bee population cannot be considered as wild, as in most areas there have been hundreds of years of selection by humans for positive traits such as producing better quality honey or less aggressive bees. Most Apis mellifera colonies are not considered to be self-sustaining as veterinary treatments against the mite Varroa destructor amongst other parasites is often provided.Numerous studies indicate that A. mellifera has undergone significant declines in Europe; however, it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies.The Western Honey Bee is therefore assessed as Data Deficient until further research enables us to differentiate between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild. Research is also required to understand the impacts of the threats to the species at the colony level, in particular from Varroa destructor and its associated pathogens, malnutrition and herbicides, pesticides and fungicides. Action should be taken to prevent further declines of the species in Europe, if it is not already too late.",Unknown,"Apis mellifera is native to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and western Asia.The species has a native distribution throughout the whole of Europe (Ruttner 1988), except Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, the Azores and northern Scandinavia (although managed colonies have been introduced to these areas). Throughout Europe, there are many distinct subspecies that are locally adapted to their environment (Ruttner 1988, De la Rúa et al. 2009), however, it is difficult to know where the species currently occurs in the wild, if at all, due to the introgression of managed and feral colonies with wild populations (De la Rúa et al. 2001a,b, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009; Radloff et al. 2001, Jensen et al. 2005, Muñoz et al. 2009, Jaffé et al. 2010, Thompson et al. 2010, Oleksa et al. 2011, Muñoz and De la Rúa 2012; Muñoz et al. 2012, 2013, 2014, submitted; Pinto et al. 2014).","It is currently not possible to quantify the population size and trends of all wild subpopulations of Apis mellifera (defined in this Red List assessment as self-sustaining colonies (e.g., they do not receive veterinary treatment or other management interventions) that are not affected by introduced genetic material). It is problematic to differentiate between wild, feral, and managed colonies of A. mellifera in Europe for the purposes of this assessment as the data is not readily available. However, there are indications that the species is rare, if not extinct in the wild (Moritz et al. 2007, Jaffé et al. 2010). Numerous studies indicate that A. mellifera has undergone significant declines in Europe; however, it is not clear if these studies refer to population reductions of wild, feral or managed colonies. For the whole of Europe, the population size and trend of A. mellifera remains unknown.  In relation to Honey Bee colony losses there are an increasing number of articles and special issues of scientific journals from the last decade dedicated to this topic. One of the most comprehensive was a study by Neumann and Carreck (2010) addressing the possible causes of colony losses in 16 countries. Many of these causes are briefly addressed in the threats section of this assessment.","The species lives predominantly in managed bee colonies throughout Europe, although there are potentially feral and wild bee colonies found in a wide range of habitats. Feral colonies are ones that were once managed and escaped into the wild, where they are self-sustaining (the term 'feral' is associated more with Africanized bees in the New World), while wild colonies are self-sustaining colonies (e.g., they do not receive veterinary treatment or other management interventions) that are not affected by introduced genetic material.  Generally, the species can be found to inhabit temperate forests, grasslands and even semi-deserts. Wild (and feral) colonies are also dependent on the availability of suitable natural and anthropogenic nesting sites such as tree cavities, cavities in walls and in the roofs of buildings.  In northern Europe, Apis mellifera seems to have a preference for mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape and sunflower (Rollin et al. 2013); however, this may be due to a lack of other plant resources being available in the required quantities at the right time of year. In the Iberian Peninsula, A. mellifera forage upon other plants (many wild shrubs) such as Lavandula stoechas, Erica spp, Castanea sativa, Rosmarinus officinalis, Arbutus unedo, Echium plantagineum, Mentha pulegium, Citrus sinensis, Carlina racemosa, and Eucalyptus spp. (introduced from Australia, so has only become a food plant fairly recently).A. mellifera are eusocial insects resembling a superorganism with sophisticated communication among nest mates. A. mellifera has a particular reproductive system termed polyandry, where one queen mates with 1 to 49 males/drones (Neumann et al. 1999, Palmer and Oldroyd 2000, Hernández-García et al. 2009). They also exhibit prime swarming, in which the existing queen together with part of or the entire colony leaves to form a new colony elsewhere. This is the most common event where about 60% of the worker bees leave the original hive location with the old queen. Secondary afterswarms may occur and they are usually smaller and accompanied by one or more virgin queens (Winston 1991). Mating takes place during a nuptial flight by the virgin queen in the spring and summer months (from as early as March in southern countries), preferentially on sunny days with little wind.   Queens can live between three to four years, drones for several months (they die after successful or unsuccessful mating during drone aggregations) and workers between two to three weeks in Summer and six or seven months in Winter.","Wild populations of Apis mellifera in Europe have been greatly impacted by: habitat loss (decline in availability of natural nest sites and food sources); displacement from food sources and nest sites by managed/feral colonies; disease and parasites originating from managed/feral bees; the use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides; invasive alien species; detrimental beekeeping practices and the lack of adequate pest control.  The primary threats to the species are listed below:  Habitat loss and malnutrition  Intensive land use for agriculture, commercial and residential development has led to a decrease in the range of suitable habitats available for wild and feral populations of pollinators (Kremen et al. 2002, Biesmeijer et al. 2006, Flynn et al. 2009). The lack of floral resources (pollen and nectar) in the environment may impact upon colony reserves and therefore the colony’s survival, especially over Winter. However, in parts of Europe commercial food crops (for example oil seed rape Brassica napus in the United Kingdom) may have replaced wild food and pollen sources for the Honey Bee, although it is not known whether commercial food crops are nutritionally equivalent to replace wild crop sources.  Pathogens and parasites  Varroa destructor and its associated pathogens (viruses) are considered to be the greatest threat causing declines in Europe of both managed and feral/wild colonies of A. mellifera. They have been implicated in causing colony decline in managed colonies and have most probably decimated the wild population of A. mellifera across Europe (Moritz et al. 2007, Jaffé et al. 2010, Moritz et al. 2010).  Managed colonies and therefore wild colonies are also impacted by many viruses (20 have been described to date) some of which are associated with and transmitted by Varroa destructor (e.g., Deformed Wing Virus), pathogens and parasites (Nosema spp. and Acarapis woodi (Honey Bee tracheal mite)), foulbroods and a range of other brood disorders (Moritz et al. 2010).  Fürst et al. (2014) demonstrated the transfer of disease from managed A. mellifera colonies to Bombus spp., an occurrence that can certainly apply to wild colonies of A. mellifera.  Pollution - pesticides, herbicides and fungicides  The most widely used pesticides are those of the neonicotinoid family and, along with herbicides and fungicides, these may impact upon the forage availability of	 A. mellifera as well as having a direct impact upon their health (Izuru 1999, Blacquiere et al. 2012). The evidence on the damage these insecticides cause is conflicting for now (Henry et al. 2012, Fischer et al. 2014).  The Asian Hornet  The Asian Hornet (Vespa velutina) was first introduced in south-western France. This is a new threat as it preys upon A. mellifera and it has spread from France to neighbouring countries in Europe such as Spain, Portugal and Belgium. The species is now established, at least in France, and eradication is no longer possible (Rortais et al. 2010).  Detrimental beekeeping practices  Detrimental beekeeping practices create problems for A. mellifera colonies and, potentially, other flower visitors/pollinators (Evison et al. 2012, Fürst et al. 2014,). These unfavourable practices include: migratory beekeeping, the trade in queens, large scale selective breeding, and the incorrect application of disease treatments all contribute to the loss of genetic diversity and resilience of bee populations, both managed and wild (De la Rúa et al. 2009). The Buckfast Bee (a man-made race combining a number of sub-species from Europe and Africa) may also be a threat because it contributes to the destruction of local ecotypes as it is a man-made bee race from many different strains of bees.  Lack of adequate pest control  Varroa destructor control is currently unsustainable as the chemicals that are used are short-term effective as the mite develops (evolves) resistance. The chemicals are therefore no longer very effective.","Further research is needed to be able to differentiate between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild (Jaffé et al. 2010). However, Thompson et al. (2014) conducted conducted research on feral and managed Apis meillifera in England and Wales and found no wild specimens while feral bees showed close similarities to managed Honey Bees (2.5%). Further research is required to determine the continued existence, distribution, and trends of wild colonies. Identification of colonies that survive without beekeeping management would be a significant step, as would the genetic characterisation of those populations. Research is also required to understand the effects of the threats to the species, both at the species level and colony levels, in particular from Varroa destructor and associated pathogens, malnutrition, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides.  Most of the current conservation actions have not differentiated between wild and managed bees but as both forage in the wild, the positive effects will be felt by both population types.  The most recent action for the conservation of Apis mellifera was an EU-wide ban on three neonicotinoids pesticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) applied to ""crops attractive to bees"". This was approved by the European Union and came into force in December 2013 (Official Journal of the European Union 2013). The restriction will last for up to two years, with a scientific review of the ban taking place as soon as new information is available. Much more research is expected to emerge on the topic in the coming years.   Agri-environmental schemes are important in order to provide vital resources for A. mellifera to utilize. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) includes a section on the greening of agricultural practices and this will involve three basic measures: maintaining permanent grassland, crop diversification, and maintaining an ecological focus area of at least 5% of the arable area of the holding. It is expected to improve the quality and extent of habitats available for A. mellifera.   Other measures include promoting the use of native A. mellifera subspecies for honey production and the restriction on importation of non-native queens in order to slow down the rate of introgression and allow for natural genetic resistance to develop within populations.   In addition, there are currently three main networks and projects working for the conservation of the A.mellifera which are summarised below:  The COLOSS network (prevention of honey bee COlony LOSSes), an international, non-profit association head-quartered in Bern, Switzerland, is currently working on improving the well-being of the Honey Bee at a global level. It is composed of scientific professionals, including researchers, veterinarians, agriculture extension specialists, and students from over 60 countries.   As part of the COLOSS network the Research Network for Sustainable Bee Breeding (RNSBB) whose aim is to improve Honey Bee welfare by developing and disseminating comprehensive breeding strategies that include colony vitality and the conservation of locally adapted populations.  The project Status and Trends of European Pollinators aims to document declines in managed European Honey Bee populations and, though it focuses on pollinators, it aims to understand the drivers of decline in honey bees.  Recently another network, the Super-B (Sustainable Pollination in Europe: joint Research on Bees and other pollinators), has been set up to integrate knowledge and develop methods that underpin sustainable pollination services in Europe.","Apis mellifera is considered to be one of the most important pollinators of crops and other plant species (Delaplane et al. 2000).   However, the scale of pollination services provided by wild colonies is unclear because of the lack of data on the size and distribution of the wild population of the Apis mellifera in Europe (Jaffé et al. 2010).Honey is not known to be harvested from wild colonies in Europe.","De la Rúa, P., Paxton, R.J., Roberts, S., Pinto, M.A., Cauia, E., Fontana, P., Kryger, P., Bouga, M., Buechler, R., Costa, C., Crailsheim, K., Meixner, M., Kosmus, P., Siceanu, A., Allen, D.J. & Kemp, J.R.","Neumann, P., Nieto, A. & Hilton-Taylor, C.",

The species is listed as Vulnerable because its area of occupancy (AOO) is 700 km2 and 328 km2 for Europe and the EU 27 respectively, based on currently known records. Although the species is believed to occupy a larger area, the AOO for both Europe and EU 27 is certainly less than 2,000 km2. Moreover, there is a continuing decline in AOO, the extent and quality of habitat, and in the number of mature individuals. The species has experienced a strong decline in its population in Scandinavia since 2010, a decline that may have been repeated in parts of European Russia (Filippov 2014). The species is considered to be undergoing extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals due to the unpredictable occurrence of heatwaves in Arctic Scandinavia; the situation in European Russia is not known, but is expected to be similar.Research is required to establish the current distribution of the species throughout its range, and to better understand climate change impacts on the species' populations and distribution. Further research is needed to identify the range of genetic diversity. The species should be reassessed when further population trend and distribution data become available.",Decreasing,"The overall range of Bombus polaris is circumpolar (Richards 1973, Rasmont and Iserbyt 2010-2012), mainly confined to the Arctic tundra.In North America,  it stays north of the 60th parallel, except in a few places in Labrador, on the  Hudson Bay and in Quebec, but always beyond and above the tree line. It is also found in  the islands: on Baffin and Ellesmere, and even in the far north of  Greenland, i.e. well above the 80° N. In continental Russia and Siberia, it  is restricted to the coast of the Arctic Ocean. It is also present on Novaia  Zemlia, Wrangel and some other Siberian islands (Berezin 1995). As in Greenland, B. polaris can be found up to the 83rd parallel. In northwestern Europe the species is distributed from southern Norway (Hardangervidda) throughout the Scandinavian mountain chain to the Kola Peninsula and Arctic Russia (including the Novaia Zemlia archipelago). The known extent of occurrence (EOO) in Europe is very large (1,493,904 km2) however the area of occupancy (AOO) is 700 km2 based on currently known records; although the species is believed to occupy a larger area, the AOO is certainly less than 2,000 km2. In the EU 27, the known EOO is 195,871 km2 and the AOO is 328 km2. Likewise, the species is believed to occupy a larger area, but not much larger than 500 km2.The altitudinal range of the species varies according to the vegetation zone and latitude, and differs both within countries and across the species European distribution. For example, the tree line in southern Norway might be at about 900 m asl at the most, and close to sea level in north. The species has been recorded at 900-1,400 m asl in southern Norway but only occasionally at sea level in the north (B. Cederberg pers. comm. 2014).","There is strong evidence that the species' populations have dramatically decreased since 2010 in northern Scandinavia (P. Rasmont pers. comm. 2014). Also during this period, the species has become extremely rare in the mountains of southern Norway (A. Mjelde pers. comm. 2014). In the northeast of Russia (Komi Republic) the bee has only been observed at four sites over the past ten years, with a single queen observed at each site (Filippov 2014).Due to the increased frequency of heatwaves in Arctic Scandinavia (e.g. 34°C during two weeks at Kevo, June 2013, P. Rasmont pers. obs. 2014), the species is undergoing extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals. After the heatwaves of 2013 and 2014, only very few remaining specimens were found (P. Rasmont pers. obs. 2014).Overall, the population trend of this species is decreasing.","An Arctic species, associated with Salix biotopes, Vaccinium heaths and mountain meadows (in Norway and Sweden).It is polylectic, in that it collects pollen from a wide range of flowering plants for both nectar and pollen, but it seems particularly associated with Bartsia and Pedicularis (Orobanchaceae) in the summer.  Bombus polaris  is subject to inquilinism from B. hyperboreus.","Climate change, especially through warming and the increased occurrence of extreme temperature events (heatwaves) and local droughts impacts the bee both directly through reduced reproductive capacity and indirectly on habitat area and habitat quality (Franzen and Ockinger 2011, Franzen and Molander 2012, P. Rasmont pers. comm. 2013, B. Cederberg pers. comm. 2014). In addition, local droughts and heatwaves may contribute to population declines (Rasmont and Iserbyt 2012). Higher temperatures may directly cause mortality to the species; research has found that Alpinobombus are especially sensitive to raised temperatures, compared, for example, with Bombus monticola (P. Rasmont pers. comm. 2014).Boreoalpine species such as this bee that are adapted to cold climate will be overheated and become inactive when the temperature rises too high. During longer periods of high temperature the shallow-rooted alpine plants will stop producing nectar and wilt. Longer term, warmer summers are changing the vegetation structure. Wood-forming processes increase and in the lower alpine area, rooted dwarf plants such as birch, juniper and different scrubs have already been observed to be growing higher, and the treeline altitude is rapidly increasing. This causes a shift in the bee community, with higher competition from woodland species on the alpine fauna (B. Cederberg pers. comm. 2014)In fact, notable heatwaves in northern Scandinavia in 2013 and 2014 dramatically reduced the bees populations (P. Rasmont pers. obs. 2014). Modelling of future available suitable climatic areas shows that the species is extremely threatened by climate change (Rasmont et al. 2014).",The species is not subject to any targeted conservation action.Further research is required to establish the current distribution of the species throughout its range and to identify the range of genetic diversity.

The species makes nesting aggregations on shallow exposed slopes. The nesting biology has been studied by Vasiljeva (1973), who found three such aggregations. The nest burrows reached a maximum density of 64/m2, and favoured sites are used year after year. The species builds simple nests with lateral burrows, and the nest can reach a depth of 15 cm. Dufourea minuta is univoltine. British specimens have been found from early to mid August, but in continental Europe the species flies from the end of July to the beginning of September. In Poland, the bee Sphecodes divisus is cited as a cleptoparasite of this species (Pesenko et al. 2000). Biastes truncatus is reported as a cleptoparasite of this species (Westrich 1989).","The habitats and host-plants of Dufourea minuta are threatened by changing agricultural practices (e.g., increase of nitrogen deposition, herbicides and the trend to replace hay with silage).

Some nests have been found on SSW directed slopes and the adjacent flat ground. The surface of the ground was bare with small stones and lichen crusts. The nests are constructed in fine sandy soil of morainic origin. At the Abisko nesting sites in Arctic Sweden, the sun is above the horizon permanently between 31st May and 14th July, which presumably facilitates longer flying and flowering periods for bees and flowers respectively. There is no further information available on the habitat and ecology of this species (Svensson et al. 1977).Lasioglossum boreale is apparently a polylectic species, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species.

There is no further information available for the population size and trend of this species.,"The species is ubiquitous, but perhaps most plentiful in dry and open habitats such as swards, dry meadows, roadsides, arable field margins, forest fragments, woodland glades and margins. It is common in parks and gardens (Westrich 1989). The nesting aggregations are probably small and, despite the local abundance of this bee, are rarely found. Such an aggregation has been found in a roadside bank on Dartmoor, England (J.P. Field pers. comm. 2010). It is a primitively eusocial species which in warm climates has a summer brood of workers. The latter are smaller than their mother. Brood cells are closed following provisioning and oviposition. Gynes (the primary reproductive female caste of social insects) and males emerge from mid summer to autumn. The males sometimes emerge from queen-built brood cells, but are usually raised from those provisioned by the workers. Mating occurs inside the nest. Mated females overwinter together. In cold climates (as on mountains in northern Japan) the species is solitary, with no worker brood (Sakagami and Munakata 1972). Males of this species frequently spend the night in clusters on low vegetation (sometimes in company with those of Lasioglossum albipes) (O’Toole 1985). The species is broadly polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species, and in Germany it is known to collect pollen from species in at least fifteen plant families (Westrich 1989). Lasioglossum calceatum is univoltine, in that it has one generation per year, and with an extended flight period. The females are active from late March or early April to mid-October, and males from mid-July to mid-October. The bee Sphecodes monilicornis, is known to attack the brood cells of this species (Perkins 1945, Guichard and Yarrow 1948).

Pesenko and Banaszak et al. (2000) state that the species is oligolectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a narrow range of flowering plant species, specifically on Lamiacae. However, there are very few Polish records, and none appears to support this statement, and no further reference is given. In Switzerland, it is stated to have a preference for Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) (Amiet et al. 2001) and Ebmer (1971) lists Salvia pratensis, Thymus sp. and Stachys sp.

In the UK, at the edge of its range, it inhabits south-facing unstable clay and sand sea-cliffs with associated flower-rich grasslands (BWARS 2014). In Belgium, it is often present on calcareous soils but it is also present in quarries and mines. Lasioglossum laticeps is a gregarious species, nesting in very localised aggregations. Nevinson (1904) encountered males near burrows in the joints of a stone wall, but nesting burrows are more usually excavated in the soil.The following details are adapted from Packer (1983), who studied the species in some detail on the Charmouth-Lyme Regis landslip, Dorset (UK). He found an aggregation nesting in a 30° slope and occupying an area of about 15 square metres. The burrows were begun in dessication cracks in the clay soil, the excavated spoil being packed into these surface fissures and not forming conical tumuli surrounding the nest entrances (as in many other Lasioglossum species). As a result, nesting aggregations are difficult to locate. Spring and summer broods are reared in cells which are constructed in comb-like clusters, each of these surrounded by a cavity which is enlarged as the number of cells increases; nest development is figured by Packer. The gynes (the primary reproductive female caste of social insects) do not seem to overwinter in their natal nests. This is a eusocial species with workers being on average about 7% smaller than the gynes. There is a high proportion of males (24%) in the first brood and pupal counts from excavated cells indicated a ratio of 3:1 males to females. The species is polylectic, in that it collects pollen from a wide range of flowers species. It prefers Umbelliferae species such as Eryngium campestre and Heracleum sphondylium (Pauly 2011). In Germany, it visits: Anthriscus sylvestris, Daucus carota (Apiaceae); Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae); Brassica napus, Cardamine pratensis (Brassicaceae); Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae); Potentilla verna, Fragaria vesca, Malus domestica (Rosaceae) and Salix sp. (Salicaceae) (Westrich 1989). Ebmer (1971) lists: Taraxacum, Hieracium, Centaurea, Tussilago (Asteraceae); Ribes (Grossulariaceae); Salix (Salicaceae); Daucus, Pastinaca, Angelica (Apiaceae); Papaver (Papaveraceae); Arabis (Brassicaceae); Potentilla (Rosaceae); Origanum (Lamiaceae); Scabiosa (Dipsacaceae).The females fly from mid-April to the end of September, while males fly from early July to late September. Packer (1983) observed female Sphecodes ephippius flying low over a nesting aggregation of Lasioglossum laticeps, and he dug out a female of this kleptoparasite (one that parasitises the nests of others) from a nest of L. laticeps. He also discovered larvae of the conopid fly genus Thecophora in the gasters of 10% of workers collected in August. Many individuals of a race of small Sphecodes monilicornis have been found flying over a nesting aggregation of L. laticeps (G.R. Else pers. obs. 1987), and it is possible that the latter is also a kleptoparasite of this species.

In Germany, Westrich (1989) reports sand and gravel pits, embankments, sparse grasslands and waste places. Nests may be constructed in sand or loess, and form small aggregations (two to six nests). The species is eusocial, with the gynes (the primary reproductive female caste of social insects) establishing their nests in the spring. The brood of workers and a few males emerge in the summer. Later in the season, the new generation of gynes and a cohort of larger males are produced (see Westrich 1989). It is a polylectic bee, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species. Westrich (1989) lists the following species as pollen sources: Leucanthemum vulgare, Centaurea jacea, Cichorium intybus, Taraxacum officinale, Leontodon autumnalis, Picris hieracioides, Hypochoeris radicata (Asteraceae); Brassica napus, Sinapis alba (Brassicaceae); Convolvulus arvensis (Convolvulaceae); Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae).

It is found in meadows, forests, amongst crops and some sandy habitats. In Great Britain, the species is usually associated with sandy soils, being mainly found in sand pits and on coastal dunes. It uses inland and coastal sites, although in southern England it is predominantly coastal (G.R. Else pers. comm. 2014). R.C.L. Perkins (1923) and Stelfox (1927) describe this bee in Devon (UK) and Ireland respectively as nesting in large aggregations. In Fife (Scotland) and near Arbroath, L. nitidiusculum is nesting in earth banks where the underlying geology is red sandstone. There is a preference for the lighter soil types in Fife, where in some areas concentrations of burrows can be found along a line of lighter sandy material, avoiding more dense soils (B. Little in litt. 2013). This is a solitary species (Westrich 1989). It is broadly polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species, although it is most often found with pollen from yellow-flowered Asteraceae and Brassicaceae species.

It nests in excavated  burrows in the ground. The burrow entrances are hidden under small  shrublets. For each cell, a more or less vertical burrow (1.5 cm deep) is  excavated in rather hard soil. Up to 10 cells are built immediately  beside each other separated by a few millimetres only. The cells of a  single nest, when removed from the soil, partly adhere to each other  by small earthen bridges. The cells (c. 1.5 cm long) are entirely built of petals (e.g., of Helianthemum)  and mud. The cell walls are usually three-layered: the outer layer  consists of small to large petal pieces glued together with mud, rarely  with small pebbles as well, the central layer consists of a thin layer  of mud, which is sometimes only weakly developed, the inner layer is  composed of six to ten layers of large petal pieces without any addition of  mud. After egg deposition, the cell is closed by folding over the inner  layer of petals. Afterwards, the cell cap is built which is composed of  two layers: the inner layer is rather thick and consists of small petal  pieces glued together with mud and small pebbles, the outer layer  consists of a thin wall of petal pieces neatly glued together.  In the end, the  cell cap is hidden under a thin and loose layer of sand and small  pebbles (Rozen et al. 2010, A. Müller pers. obs. 2013).

The status of the species on the Kola Peninsula in northern European Russia (an old record near Kuzomen) is uncertain. It also occurs in northern Asia and in the Nearctic (Scheuchl 1996, Haeseler 1999, Banaszak and Romasenko 2001, B. Cederberg pers. comm. 2014). The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at between 300-500 km2.","The abundance and population size of this species are not known, although it is thought that the species is severely fragmented, such that there is little chance of genetic transfer between subpopulations. This is due to the loss of its coastal dune habitat that it is specialised upon. In Sweden the population is estimated to be between 50-250 reproducing individuals from ten known recent localities (Cederberg et al. 2010). Some of these localities are only based on single individuals and so some of these populations may have been lost. Conversely, a few subpopulations may remain undetected. In Norway, the species is known from five recent and five historical localities, although the species has been re-found in one of the historical localities. The estimated population size of the species in Norway is no more than 100 reproducing individuals (Odegaard 2012). This species has disappeared from the eastern island sites Själland, Lolland and probably Bornholm in Denmark and is now only found along the west coast of Jylland from Skagern and southwards on few recorded recent sites (Madsen and Calabuig 2010, B. Cederberg pers. comm. 2014).From the Netherlands there are only two known recent localities (after 1980) on the west Frisian Islands (Peeters et al. 1999). The species is extremely rare in Germany and only known from the east Frisian Islands (Westrich et al. 2011). This species has disappeared from the only known locality in Poland near Dartovo (W. Celary pers. comm. 2005). The population trend is decreasing."," Osmia maritima occurs in coastal white and grey sand dunes throughout its range. It nests in excavated burrows in sandy soil with one cell (occasionally up to four to 10 cells) at the end. The cells are entirely built from chewed leaf pieces (e.g. from Oenothera, Viola)  intermixed with sand grains. Dead rootlets are generally incorporated  into the cell walls (Haeseler 1982, Westrich 1989, Banaszak and Romasenko 2001). This species is polylectic, in that it prefers to forage upon a wide range of flowering plants species, with a preference for Fabaceae (Lathyrus, Lotus) (Westrich 1989).","In Sweden, when the species was suggested for an action plan (2005-2007), four of the eight previously known sites had been destroyed for the development of a harbour and a golf course, exploited by beach tourism and overgrown by rose bushes. The area of the remaining four sites were severely reduced by tourism exploitation, afforestation and invasive vegetation. That can be interpreted as a 50% reduction of sites and a reduction of habitat quality by 80-90%. Nitrogen deposition and the resulting habitat conversion/degradation also impact upon the species. The habitat in Sweden suitable for this species (EUNIS codes 2110 - White dunes and 2130 - Grey dunes) has declined. The decline in the area of EUNIS code 2110 is 50% (from 8 km2 to 4 km2) and for EUNIS code 2130 30% (from 17 km2 to 12 km2) over the last 20 years (B. Cederberg pers. comm. 2014).The coastal dune habitats in Norway, Denmark and the west and east Frisian Islands are also threatened and in decline, presumably from similar threats to those in Sweden.","Cederberg et al. (2010) propose the restoration and management of the coastal dune areas to which Osmia maritima might migrate and establish new populations and to continue the research to increase the knowledge of the species distribution. The species is recorded from within three protected areas, one in Sweden and at least two in Norway.The species is listed in the National Red Lists or Red Data Books of Germany (Rare; Westrich et al. 2011), Norway (Endangered; Kålås et al. 2010) and Sweden (Endangered; Gärdenfors et al. 2010).

The species is kleptoparasitic, in that it parasitises the nests of other bee species. Colletes cunicularius (Linnaeus) is the main host of this specialized bee (Blüthgen 1934, Westrich 1989). It has only one generation per year. It is highly probable that the females survive for a long time and fly in early summer, when Colletes is no longer available. In this situation Sphecodes albilabris can accept another (secondary) host. Old worn females have been observed entering nests of Melitturga clavicornis and the larvae of S. albilabris were excavated and described from its nest by Rozen (1965). Blüthgen (1934) also stated Halictus quadricinctus as an unconfirmed host. Females of S. albilabris have been observed invading nests of Halictus quadricinctus at the exact same site as Rozen’s (1965) observation of this species parasitizing Melliturga clavicornis. This was observed at Stroupeč Natural Monument in the Czech Republic (P. Bogusch and J.

In addition, its habitat in the Alpine region is expected to increase in extent due to the abandonment of pastures and meadows in the mountains and there are no major threats to this grasshopper. More focus should be put on assessing the situation of the subpopulations in the Balkans, which seem to be heavily fragmented and might be threatened.","This species has a wide range, but recent data on distribution and population status is almost exclusively related to the Alpine part of its distribution. There, the species is often very common and can reach high densities (Massa et al. 2012). It seems to be increasing in Italy (P. Fontana pers. comm. 2015) and also the records in the western parts of its Austrian range are more numerous than in previous decades. In contrast, in the Austrian-Slovenian Karawanken, it seems to be in retreat (unpublished data; ARGE Heuschrecken Österreich). There is little information on the status of the Balkan subpopulations, but they seem to be heavily fragmented, without any obvious increase. Therefore, the overall population trend seems to be stable.","The Long-winged Mountain Grasshopper is a mountain species, occupying the southern ridge of the distribution of the mainly Alpine genus Miramella. In the west, it lives along the southern edge of the eastern Alps in Italy, Austria and Slovenia. Its distribution extends from the Alpi Bergamasche over the mountains of Trentino-Alto Adige and the Alpi Venete, to the Hohe Tauern, Karnische Alpen, Karawanken and the Triglav mountains (Massa et al. 2012, ARGE Heuschrecken Österreich; unpublished data). Further east it continues on the Slavonian Mountains of Croatia (Szövényi and Puskás 2012) and Bosnia and Herzegovina southwards to Kosovo to reach its easternmost range in the Valahia, in southern Romania. The distribution in the western part of its range is quite dense, but east of the Alps the subpopulations are often separated by long distances. This species' extent of occurrence (EOO) in Europe is rather large, ca 270,000 km². It lives from the foothills around 500 m asl up to the mountain peaks with highest records at 2,400 m asl.","This species, like most species of the genus Miramella, is a grasshopper of habitats with medium moisture in hills and mountains. The Alpine habitats are mainly grassland with a significant amount of tall herbs and, occasionally, small bushes. Even some records from open patches inside forests are known (Massa et al. 2012, ARGE Heuschrecken Österreich; unpublished data) and it can also be present in trees up to the canopy level. It may also be found in cultivated areas such as vineyards (P. Fontana pers. comm. 2015). It prefers warmer habitats than the closely related sibling species M. formosanta and M. carinthiaca, which replace Miramella irena in the west and north of its range. However, there is no available information on the habitats of the subpopulations in the Balkans.",The species is not utilised.,"This species occupies an extensive area in the Alps and in the Balkans, living in a broad variety of altitudes. At least in the Alpine subpopulations, its habitat is not under threat and is expected to increase in its extent due to the abandonment of pastures and meadows in the mountains. There are no major threats to the species.","This species is found in several protected areas throughout its range, but the majority of the population resides outside protected areas. There are no special conservation measures targeted at this species, in spite of the fact that it was classified as Vulnerable in a previous assessment. Research and monitoring should focus on the subpopulations of the Balkans, as their status is relatively unclear."

This species is assessed as Critically Endangered since it has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of ca 40 km², the population is severely fragmented and shows extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals. In addition, a continuing decline in the EOO, area of occupancy (AOO), number of subpopulations, extent and quality of the habitat and in the number of mature individuals has been observed. In the past, this species declined mainly because of the destruction of its habitat, which has been transformed into meadows, orchards, olive yards or industrial areas. One of the remaining subpopulations is found in a military area and another within a car training course, where the construction of a new road is planned. The reasons for the decline of this species within the nature reserve ""Réserve naturelle nationale des Coussouls de Crau"" are poorly understood and are being studied. A conservation strategy was developed in 2014 and is currently being implemented. A captive breeding programme has been established at Thoiry Zoo and the first experimental reintroductions of egg pods were performed in 2015. Suitable habitat management needs to be implemented as soon as the major threats are understood. Remaining unprotected habitats should be integrated into the reserve. Destroyed habitats need to be restored and the plans for new road constructions need to be stopped.","The Crau Plain Grasshopper has dramatically declined during the 20ᵗʰ century as a consequence of the destruction of its habitat (Foucart et al. 1999). Since the beginning of the 21ˢᵗ Century the species has strongly declined even within the protected area (""Réserve naturelle nationale des Coussouls de Crau""). A population reduction of 70% during the last ten years is suspected from the reduction of its area of occupancy (AOO). The remaining subpopulations are very isolated and separated by roads (Streiff et al. 2005). The species is flightless, not able to recolonise sites rapidly, and subpopulations may go extinct with a reduced probability of recolonization. The population is therefore considered severely fragmented. The species is also known to show extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals (A. Foucart pers. comm. 2015). Based on a recent mark-recapture experiment, the complete population size is likely to smaller than 5,000 mature individuals.","The Crau Plain Grasshopper is endemic to the Crau Steppe in southern France (Foucart and Lecoq 1998). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is ca 40 km², and its area of occupancy (AOO) is ca 12 to 16 km².","This species occurs only in a stone steppe habitat. It prefers areas which are rich in stones and scarce in vegetation. The generation length is one year, nymphs hatch in April and become adult at the end of May. Adults can be found until the beginning of July. Eggs appear to take two years for development (L. Bröder, L. Tatin and A.

Another subpopulation is found within a car training course, where currently the construction of a new road is planned. The reasons for the decline within the nature reserve are poorly understood. It is currently being studied whether it might have been affected by predation (by birds, e.g. cattle egret, which has strongly increased in this area), by sheep medication (since many grasshoppers regularly feed on sheep faeces), by general changes of the grazing regime (e.g. overgrazing), or by climate change (e.g. droughts during the egg period).","Parts of the Crau Steppe are protected in the ""Réserve naturelle nationale des Coussouls de Crau"" since 2001, but other parts are not protected.

A strategic conservation plan for the Crau Plain Grasshopper has been developed in 2014 and is currently being implemented (Hochkirch et al. 2014). This includes research into the population size and threats as well as a captive breeding program at Thoiry Zoo. Furthermore, the site of one of the remaining subpopulations has been excluded from grazing during the activity period of the grasshopper, while grazing in spring (before eggs were hatching) has been applied at another site that was overgrown with vegetation. Awareness programs are also underway. Suitable habitat management needs to be implemented as soon as the major threats are understood. Remaining unprotected habitats should be integrated into the reserve. Destroyed habitats need to be restored and the plans for new road constructions need to be stopped. Reintroduction is planned at sites where the species became extinct recently as soon as the reasons for its disappearance are understood. The species should be protected by law."

This species is assessed as Least Concern since it has a large geographic range, it is widespread (even abundant in suitable habitats), and it occurs over a broad range of altitudes. However, the threats to this species, which are mainly related to the availability and quality of its habitat, seem to affect several parts of the species´ range. In addition, this species has experienced declines in the past, and the current population trend is presumed to be decreasing.

Sub-populations in the lowlands of Switzerland declined in earlier decades due to intensification of viticulture or housing development. In the core areas, reforestation and the overgrowth of open habitats lead to local extinctions (Baur and Roesti 2006). In Italy, this species is found quite scattered and it experienced declines in the past (P. Fontana pers. comm. 2015). Overall the population trend is presumed to be decreasing.","Due to the complicated taxonomic status of the allopatric E. ephippiger species-aggregate (e.g., Baur and Coray 2004) there is some confusing information in the literature on the distribution of this species. According to the current knowledge, it is an endemic species of the south-western part of the Alps, concentrated in the mountain regions of Italy and Switzerland between the Lago Maggiore and the region of Trentino, reaching northwards to the southern parts of the Tessin and Graubünden. An isolated record originates from the Alpi Marittimi (Baur et al. 2006, Massa et al. 2012). Published records from Styria (Austria) and Istria (Croatia) seem to belong to another Ephippiger species. This species lives in the mountains and can be found at a broad range of elevations between 330 and 1,680 m asl (Baur and Roesti 2006). Its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) in Europe is 34,000 km².","This species is an bush-cricket of dense growth in shrubs and herbs, living on warm and dry mountain slopes with a good density of bushes and larger herbs suitable for climbing. Typical habitats are sun-exposed forest edges, older clear-cuts, hedgerows in agricultural areas and pastures with interspersed shrub (Baur and Roesti 2006). This species is a good climber, mainly living quite secretively on bushes and herbs. The males sing during the day. Adults can be found comparatively late from end of July till the beginning of November (Baur and Roesti 2006).",The species is not utilised.,"This species is rather characteristic of the extensively managed cultural landscape. In the lowlands, these habitats are threatened by agricultural intensification (mainly due to reduction of important landscape elements like bushes and hedgerows), and the development of human settlements in these climatically attractive places (like in the Tessin, Bauer and Roesti 2006). The planting of vineyards has also reduced the suitable habitat of this species. In higher areas, where the majority of the subpopulations are found, abandonment of small-scale agriculture (especially extensive pastures) lead locally to natural overgrowth or intentional reforestation, resulting in a loss of quality of suitable open habitats for this heat-loving species  (Baur and Roesti 2006). The scope of these threats is not well surveyed, especially in the important area of the Italian Alps, but it can be assumed, that these factors will affect the species in the near future.","This species is not subject to direct conservation action, but it occurs in several protected areas. Parts of its habitat should be target through the agro-environmental schemes of the European Union, which supports low-impact farming and also the preservation of landscape elements like bushes or hedges. The effects of the abandonment of land use in the core areas of this species should be monitored to clarify the scope of this threat."

Conservation measures are urgently needed. The habitats of this species are protected under the Habitats Directive of the European Union, but specifically targeted actions such as a conservation project are needed to save this charismatic and endangered species. In Europe this species is assessed as Least Concern since there are large subpopulations in the Lower Volga region in Russia, and the European AOO is therefore likely to exceed 2,000 km² by far.","The overall population size of this species is unknown, but the population is severely fragmented since the subpopulations are isolated with little or no genetic exchange between them and may go extinct with a reduced probability of recolonization. This species is already extinct in Austria and Germany. Large suitable habitats can host quite big numbers of this species, like at the Durance and Romanche rivers, where Carron et al. (2001) found subpopulations with several thousands of individuals. However, the long-term decline has not stopped, and there is an ongoing population reduction observed in the remaining subpopulations in Europe. For instance, Baur et al. (2006) proved the extinction of the last subpopulation of the Italian Alps at Prato al Stelvio in 2004. As part of the reintroduction that took place in Switzerland, thirty-seven nymphs were placed in the site; the subpopulation is still present nowadays. This species seems to still have large subpopulations in the Lower Volga region in Russia.","The River Blue-legged Grasshopper occupies a very large Palaearctic range from the Atlantic coast in the west to the Pacific coast of China in the far east, but it mainly occurs in heavily fragmented subpopulations, especially in the western part of its distribution (Harz 1957, Defaut et al. 2009, Massa et al. 2012). Two subspecies are known from Europe: E. t. tergestinus lives along the coastlines of the Altlantic ocean in France, the Adriatic sea in Italy and Croatia such as at the coast of the Black Sea in Romania - but all these occurrences are isolated and small. The other subspecies, E. t. ponticus, is even more restricted. It occurred on alpine rivers in central Europe, but after a long-term decline there is only one subpopulation on several rivers in the French Alps left (Carron et al. 2001). However, it was reintroduced at one site in the internal occidental Alps in 2004 and since then this subpopulation has colonised suitable habitats well (Werner 2005). At present, the nominate subspecies has its most important European distribution along the French coast from Loire-Atlantique southwards to the Gironde, with a concentration on the estuary of the Gironde and Charente (Defaut et al. 2009). Isolated from this range it was also reported from the Spanish coast, from the San Vicente de la Barquera near Santander (Herrera 1982). The Mediterranean subpopulation is restricted to a few coastal localities in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto and Lazio, but in most of these sites the species is assumed to have disappeared (Massa et al. 2012). Another locality is reported from the island of Cres in Croatia. The only known site left along the Black Sea lies in the Bulgarian Dobrudscha (Iorgu et al. 2008). Occurrences along the Volga region in Russia lead to the Asian part of the world distribution. The subspecies E. t. ponticus has a much more restricted distribution and today - after a long decline - it is only known from the alpine rivers of the Durance, Romance and Giffre in the Hautes-Alpes, Isére and Haute-Savoie (Carron et al. 2001). In the EU 28 this species' extent of occurrence (EOO) is ca 1.2 million km², but its area of occupancy (AOO) is only between 60 and 100 km². In Europe, the species seems to have still large subpopulations in the Lower Volga region and its AOO is therefore likely to exceed 2,000 km² by far.","This species is a highly specialised grasshopper of coastal and alluvial habitats. In Europe, it is restricted to salt marshes and adjacent biotopes along the coast (E. t. tergestinus) and the sandy banks of alpine rivers (E. t. ponticus). Important habitat factors for this species attracted to sunny sites are large sandy or silty banks and shorelines that are periodically flooded and sun-exposed (Carron et al. 2001). This species is an indicator of large-scale natural, undrained and unregulated wetlands and can quickly disappear after alteration of the hydrological conditions due to human activity. This is a very mobile species, capable of coping with highly dynamic situations, like floods or massive gravel movement in its habitats.",The species is not utilised.,"The main threat to this species in Europe is the massive regulation and deterioration of native alpine and coastal wetlands due to human activity. The regulation of the alpine rivers and their widespread conversion for hydropower use or gravel-mining destroyed most of the former distribution sites of the alpine subspecies E. t. ponticus. The fragmented subpopulations of the nominate form on the coasts also suffered for a long time from intensive alteration of the native habitats by humans and tourism. In spite of the extremely high value of these habitats for the conservation of biodiversity, negative impacts are still ongoing, leading to a continuing loss of subpopulations.","Taking into account the depleted situation of the whole European population of this species after more than a century of continuing decline, conservation action is urgently needed. For the Alpine subspecies, which has the highest risk of extinction, Carron et al. (2001) propose an international action plan to save the last surviving subpopulations, which are also indicators of a highly diverse and endangered fauna and flora of these natural braided rivers. The coastal subpopulations also need international action urgently, to avoid further population declines and to open possibilities to recolonise formerly occupied areas. The habitats of this species are protected under the Habitats Directive of the European Union, but specifically targeted action such as a conservation project is needed to save this charismatic and endangered species. Only a very small proportion of this species lives in protected areas like National parks (e.g., Delta Dunarii)."

However, the larger mountainous part of the population seems to be stable. As it was described only recently (Fontana and Pozzebon 2007), important knowledge on the population trend and threats to this species is not yet available. Further research is needed into the distribution, potential threats, and population dynamics of this species. In addition, research into its taxonomic status and other closely related Podisma-species should be carried out.","This species lives in rather large subpopulations within suitable habitats of its small AOO. It can be locally abundant at lower altitudes.

However, the population is assumed to be decreasing.","The Ventoux Mountain Grasshopper is endemic to the far south-western Alps in France in the Département Vaucluse, with a higher concentration around Mont Ventoux. This species was described by Fontana and Pozzebon (2007) and is closely related to the widespread Podisma pedestris, from which it is most obviously separated by a distinct row of dorsal dots in the female. It is supposed by Fontana and Pozzebon (2007), that this species evolved in a refugial area around Mont Ventoux during the ice ages. Most of the records are from the southern slopes of Mont Ventoux, but it also occurs on the northern sides of this mountain. Further records are known from the Alpes de Haute Provence (Drôme: Séderon, Montagne de Lure) to the east and from the Petites Alpes du Dauphiné to the north (Col de Cabre, Bézaudun-sur-Bine).

It occurs on mountain slopes from comparably low altitudes at 820 m up to the mountain tops at 2,500 m asl (Fontana and Pozzebon 2007).","This species lives in dry and hot mountainous habitats from the lower foothills up to climatically suitable peaks like the top of Mont Ventoux. It seems to be more adapted to dry and hot conditions than the other closely related species of the genus Podisma (Fontana and Pozzebon 2007). It is found in open grasslands, often with a high proportion of rocks and screes (Wagner 2005-2016, Fontana and Pozzebon 2007).It lives mainly on bare ground, and adults can be found over a long season from July to October.",The species is not utilised.,"Due to its restricted range, partly outside of protected areas, this species is rather sensitive to potential threats. Intensive touristic activities, possibly leading to habitat conversion at the easily accessible Mont Ventoux pose an important threat to this species (W. Wagner pers. comm. 2015). Abandonment of grasslands and habitat shifts due to climate change can also pose a threat to this species. Detailed information on these threats is lacking, and more research on the topic is needed.","There are no conservation measures targeted at this species, but it occurs in protected areas such as the Reserves de Biosphere Luberon-Lure and Mont Ventoux.

However, the subpopulations in central Europe have experienced a long-term decline that is still ongoing in many areas, especially at lower altitudes. Recent threats such as the overgrowth of sun-exposed unproductive pastures and grasslands as a result of abandonment, the increase in vegetation cover due to nitrogen emissions and climatic changes seem to affect only the range-restricted subpopulations. Further research is needed, particularly on the extra-Alpine subpopulations of central and southeastern Europe and maybe also on the two range-restricted subspecies of the Italian Alps, which might be at much higher risk than the whole species.","This species occurs in a wide area with quite different habitats, resulting in a variety of subpopulation densities and trends. Core areas like the Alps and Switzerland are well occupied, the species can be quite common and the subpopulations seem to be relatively stable. Central European subpopulations have experienced a long-term decline that is still ongoing in many areas, especially at lower altitudes (e.g., in parts of Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic). The subpopulations in south-eastern Europe are quite fragmented and it is likely that there is no genetic exchange between them any more. The subpopulation in Fennoscandia seems to be stable. Overall the population trend seems to be decreasing.","The Common Mountain Grasshopper is a Palearctic species, occurring in most parts of Europe and ranging with several subspecies eastwards into Asia to the Caucasus, Mongolia and China. In Europe, it has a disjunct distribution with the southern range extending from the Pyrenean mountains across the Alps and the lower mountain areas of Central Europe into the Balkans, reaching the Black Sea. The northern range covers Scandinavia (outside Denmark), Finland and northwest Russia. There are two very range-restricted subspecies in the Italian Alps - P. p. caprai in the Alpi Finestre in Piemonte and P. p. nadigi at few localities in the northeastern Trentino (Massa et al. 2012). Apart from the Alps, occurrences are often isolated and separated by vast uninhabited areas. Especially in central Europe, larger parts of its range have been abandoned during the 20th century (e.g., Maas et al. 2002 for Germany), and the small Czech subpopulation is already extinct (R. Vlk pers. comm. 2015). It occupies a large range of elevations, occurring from near sea level in its northern area up to the rocky mountain-summits at 2,800 m asl (in Switzerland, Baur and Roesti 2006). In Europe, this species' extent of occurrence is estimated to be 5.6 million km².","This species prefers dry, warm habitats in most of its range, shifting to moister habitats in the warmer climate of the Balkans (e.g., Bulgaria, D. Chobanov pers. comm. 2015) or the south-western Alps. It lives on the ground, preferring grassland with low vegetation-cover and a certain amount of bare sun-exposed ground. The eggs are laid into the ground and may remain there up to two seasons before hatching, as a means to cope with occasional harsh environmental conditions in the habitat (e.g. mountain peaks, subarctic habitats). Adults can be found from June to October, and the species does not produce any sound.",The species is not utilised.,"This species has undergone a marked decline in its central European range, but the reasons of this decrease are often not clear. Main threats seem to be the overgrowth of sun-exposed unproductive pastures and grasslands as a result of abandonment, the increase in vegetation cover due to nitrogen emissions and maybe also climatic changes leading to moister and less ""continental"" climate conditions. In some parts of its area (e.g., Northern Germany) suitable habitats were turned into forests or fields. This species can survive over long periods in isolated subpopulations with small numbers of individuals (Detzel 1998) and despite its normally flightless appearance, the occasional occurrence of fully-winged individuals allows a connection of subpopulations or leads to the re-colonisation of suitable habitats.","There are no known conservation measures targeting this species, but it occurs in many protected areas, covering different ranges and habitats. Especially the threatened subpopulations outside of the Alps should be monitored and the nature of the ongoing threats should be investigated. As the Alpine and Fenno-Scandinavian subpopulations seem to be secure so far, research should focus on the central and southeastern European subpopulations."

The extent of suitable habitat is therefore limited and will probably decline in the future, e.g. due to the rise of the forest line.

It was first described from the Zirbitzkogel, a mountain famous for endemic glacial relict species in the province of Styria. Further research revealed a distribution also reaching southwards to the Hohenwart mountain in Carinthia (Pucher 2014). This species can be found at elevations between 1,743 and 2,124 m asl, but 90% of all records originate from a very narrow range between 1,800 and 2,000 m asl (unpublished data; ARGE Heuschrecken Österreich). This species' extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are quite similar and one of the smallest of the grasshoppers endemic to the Alps (47 and 36 km² respectively).","This species, like the other three European species of this genus, is a characteristic grasshopper of mountain summits, living on wind-exposed, but rather plane slopes, covered by open alpine habitats on crystalline rock (Koschuh 2008). The habitats are mainly Alpine grassland, dominated by Nardus stricta and Carex curvula and typically intermixed with dwarf shrub heath (especially Loiseleuria spp., Vaccinium spp. and Calluna spp.). Alternating dry and wet patches are typical for its habitats where this species favours the moist parts with dense vegetation-cover (Koschuh 2008). The meadows are  extensively grazed by cattle.

At the moment there are no obvious threats to this species, but in the case of ongoing climate change, going along with a shift of habitats towards higher elevations (Dirnböck et al. 2011), the species could lose substantial parts of its habitat. This species is adapted to moist habitats and the large majority of the records originate from a very narrow elevation range from the mountain tops just 200 m downwards. Taking into account the extent of the effects of climate change and the distribution of this species, it is considered to occur at only one location.","There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, but it could be a good flagship species for the conservation of the very typical alpine grasslands of this region (""Naturpark Zirbitzkogel-Grebenzen""), which are also occupied by the charismatic bird.

Holusa pers. comm. 2015). The same is assumed for the Carpathian Mts. (Kristin and Iorgu 2014). For Hungary, a long-term decline has been noted (G. Szövenyi pers. comm. 2015). Even though there is no global analysis of the population trend available, a continuous decline is inferred in Europe. The species is flightless (although a macropterous morph sometimes occurs) and western subpopulations are usually very small and isolated (Weyer et al. 2012). The overall population trend appears to be decreasing.","The Water-meadow Grasshopper (Chorthippus montanus) is widespread in Eurasia. In Europe, it is found on the Pyrenees, the Alps and the South Carpathians to northern Scandinavia and eastern European Russia (Heller 2013).

The eggs require a constant water supply and are sensitive to droughts (Ingrisch 1983).",This species is not utilised.,"The main threats to this species are drainage, abandonment, intensification of grassland management (e.g. higher cattle densities, increased number of mowing on meadows) and transformation of grassland into farmland. Subpopulation declines and collapses have been found to be related to droughts (K. Rohde pers. comm. 2015) and could be related to climate change. Hybridisation with the Meadow Grasshopper (P. parallelus) may threaten small subpopulations (Rohde 2015).","The species is listed as Vulnerable on the national Red Lists of Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Netherlands (Proess and Meyer 2003, Monnerat et al. 2007, Bakker et al. 2015) and as Near Threatened on the Red Lists of France, Austria and Germany (Sardet and Defaut 2004, Berg et al. 2005, Maas et al. 2011). The species is a very good indicator for stable wetland habitats, and should receive more attention in conservation. There is a need for more data concerning its population trend as local subpopulation declines are strong. It occurs in protected areas throughout its range. However, its habitats need generally a better protection and management to avoid any future declines. Destroyed habitats should be restored."

This species is assessed as Least Concern in Europe since it has an extremely large geographic range and the overall population size is likely to be very large. However, the species is known to be declining in large parts of its range (mainly in the western part) as a consequence of destruction of its gravel habitats by river regulations and dams, and of its heathland habitats by transformation into farmland and afforestation. In the EU 28, this species is assessed as Vulnerable since its area of occupancy (AOO) has been estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,500 km², the population is severely fragmented and there is a continuing decline in the AOO, extent and quality of the habitat, number of subpopulation and number of mature individuals.

Restoration of natural river courses, particularly of natural floodplain dynamics and its heathland habitats is also required. Research into its population trend, particularly in the eastern part of its range, is recommended.","A strong decline of this species has been documented in the western part of its range. In Germany, the decline was documented in the 1990s, but probably started earlier. A monitoring program from 1996 to 2005 showed another strong decline in 1999 (Schödl 2007). In Poland, the species has disappeared from many localities in mountains as a result of environmental changes (A. Liana pers. comm. 2016). The species is extremely rare in Italy with the largest subpopulation (near Lerpa) consisting of c. 50 individuals on 1,000 m² (Fontana et al. 2004). In Germany, a mark-recapture study has shown that the largest subpopulation at the river Isar consisted of 144 individuals (Maag et al. 2013), while a subpopulation in Austria was estimated to consist of 1,912 individuals in 1993 (on 5,000 m²) and 2,721 in 1994 (Schwarz-Waubke 2001).

It is listed on annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive and its European status has been classified mostly as ""unfavourable-inadequate"". There is a continuing decline in the number of subpopulations and mature individuals, but its area of occupancy (AOO) is very large and it exceeds the thresholds of a threatened category. More detailed research into its distribution and population trend.","This species is widely distributed but subpopulations are usually small and isolated (Massa et al. 2012). However, it is also difficult to detect. The population is very scattered and exchange between subpopulations is unlikely, and subpopulations may go extinct with reduced probability of recolonisation. The population is therefore considered severely fragmented (B. Massa, T. Zuna-Kratky, J.J. Presa, A. Kristin, C. Monnerat, I. Iorgu, G. Puskás, O. Korsunovskaya, D. Chobanov and J. Skejo pers. comm. 2016). This species shows repeated fluctuations in population size, with the number of mature individuals fluctuating at least tenfold. It is therefore considered to exhibit extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals (B. Massa, I. Iorgu and T. Zuna-Kratky pers. comm. 2016). In parts of Austria the population is increasing, but in western Austria the species is close to extinction (T. Zuna-Kratky pers. comm. 2016). In the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Slovakia and Romania it is also still decreasing (Fedor 2001, Holusa et al. 2010, A. Kristin, I. Iorgu and C. Monnerat pers. comm. 2016).

It should be investigated if this species is not conspecific with Z. marmorata.,"The Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) is a medium-sized species known from a few localities in Italy and Slovenia. It is found in wet coastal areas and marshland with Juncus species. This species is assessed as Endangered since it has a restricted geographic range (extent of occurrence (EOO) is ca 3,000 km², area of occupancy (AOO) is between 20 and 36 km²), it occurs at only five locations and the population is severely fragmented. In addition, there is a continuing decline in the AOO, the number of mature individuals and in the extent and quality of the habitat. The main threats to this bush-cricket are drainage of its habitats, succession with trees and reed and transformation of wet sedge meadows into cornfields. The remaining habitat of this species needs to be preserved and further drainage needs to be stopped. Already drained areas should be restored and a monitoring program for the species and its habitat should be established.","Since its description in 1853, the species had only been recorded from a few localities. It was thought to be extinct until 1996, when a large subpopulation was found near Monfalcone (Kleukers et al. 1997). Two more subpopulations have been meanwhile found in the region (Isonzo river delta and Marano lagoon). The Italian subpopulations are continuously declining, as most of the habitat is not managed and partly drained. It is deteriorating as a consequence of encroachment of bushes and reed (F. Tami pers. comm. 2016). In Slovenia, the species was discovered in 2004 in Ljubljansko barje between Ig and Skofjliika (Gomboc and Šegula 2005). In 2008 the number of singing males in the Slovenian subpopulation was estimated at about 1,000 (resulting from an inferred subpopulation size of 2,000) in an area of about 1 km² (Veenvliet 2008). This area has recently been partly transformed into cornfields, and the Slovenian subpopulation is therefore declining (P. Veenvliet pers. comm. 2016, S. Gomboc pers. comm. 2016). The population is considered to be severely fragmented as the species is flightless and the distance between the subpopulations is very large, so that exchange between subpopulations is very unlikely and they may become extinct with a reduced probability of recolonization.","The Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket is found in northeastern Italy (Kleukers et al. 1997) and in Slovenia near Ljubljana (Massa et al. 2012). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is ca 3,000 km², whereas its area of occupancy (AOO) is between 20 and 36 km².","This species is found in open wetland habitats. In Italy, it occurs in wet coastal marshland mainly in brackish areas with Phragmites spp. vegetation (not too dense). In Slovenia, it is found in wet meadows with Carex spp. and Filipendula ulmaria. Its altitudinal range is 0-300 m Asl.",This species is not utilized.,"The main threat to this species is the draining of its habitat. In Monfalcone (Lisert springs), habitats have disappeared due to the encroachment of reed and trees. In the past, the species has strongly declined due to the intensive use of pesticides for mosquito control. Near Monfalcone, the habitat has been partly destroyed for an industrial area, and other habitats have been drained. In Slovenia, the marshes near Ljubljana have recently been partly transformed into crop fields. Based on the threat of encroachment of shrubs and reed caused by drainage, there are only four locations in Italy, and based on the threat of transformation of this species' habitat into crop fields, there is only one location in Slovenia. The population therefore occurs at five locations.","The species is present in protected areas. A conservation strategy for it is currently being developed. A second intensive survey of the Slovenian subpopulation took place in 2016, showing that the distribution in this area has decreased. In Italy, a first mapping of the subpopulations has been done in 2016. The remaining habitat needs to be preserved. Further drainage and transformation of its habitat into cornfields need to be stopped. Already deteriorated areas should be restored and a suitable management of the sedge meadows in Slovenia needs to be implemented. A monitoring program for the species and its habitat needs to be established. Furthermore, research is needed to clarify the relationship of this species to Zeuneriana amplipennis, which occurs in Serbia and Romania."

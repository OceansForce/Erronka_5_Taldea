In Sweden it is in 11 localities, mostly in the east, and in Finland in eight localities.",In Finland the trend is stable. In Sweden the species is thought to be declining and is very fragmented.,This is an obligate saproxylic species. The larvae live in the thick dead bark of old standing aspen Populus tremula trees both in shaded and open areas. It however seems to prefer sun exposed dying or recently dead trees.,"There is lack of information available regarding the threats for this species.  The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density. Exploitation from forestry is a key immediate issue and the removal of dead and dying trees is clearly a problem. Forest clearance, unsustainable forest management, grazing, and drainage are also issues. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors. In Finland, the species may become threatened if there were more use or demand for aspen trees which would lead to more removal of the large trees. Additionally, moose eat aspen saplings and may pose a threat to aspen regeneration weakening the future habitat for this species.","This species is listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. This species is listed as Vulnerable in the Red Data Book of Sweden (2005 and 2000) and Endangered in Finland (Rassi et al. 2001). However, there is some new information on the occurrence of this species in Finland which will move the species nationally into Vulnerable or Near Threatened. The species was first found about 20 years ago in Finland, but is not seen very frequently. The situation may be improving because aspen trees are more often being left dead in open areas, providing habitat for the species.In Sweden this species is likely to struggle unless conditions change. Its habitat and distribution is very fragmented, with it being found in 11 localities.","Tykarski, P., Putchkov, A. & Mannerkoski, I."

This species lives in veteran trees which are currently in decline across Europe; regeneration of these trees is slow and there  may still be a 'gap' during which time there would be very little suitable habitat available for this species.It develops in Quercus. The larvae first develop under the bark of stressed living or dying trees, later burrowing deeper in the wood of sick, sun-exposed stems. The life cycle is at least three years, with pupation in late summer in the wood. Adults winter in the pupal cell and emerge in V-VIII, and are found on the host plants - it is predominantly a nocturnal and crepuscular species. In France trees (Quercus, Castanea) with traces of C. cerdo usually have a diameter greater than 40 cm and are sun exposed. The species is below the altitude of 900 m. In Romania it has been reported from all type of oaks. In the south, it has been found in Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens, Quercus pedunculiflora, and in the north, it has been found in Quercus robur, Quercus petraea. Adults became active from mid May, until August in mountains. During the day they are hidden inside holes, under bark, and during the evening they become active. In the European part of Turkey larvae are said to develop in Acer, Carpinus, Castanea, Cupressus, Fraxinus, Fagus, Platanus, Prunus, Salix, Quercus, Ulmus. Adults are active in VI-VII and the life cycle is three or four years (Canakcioglu 1993).  In Hungary this species lives in thermophilous oak woods (mainly in turkey oak woods) in the hills and the lower mountain areas. Important populations occur in wood pastures and parklands where huge, old, solitary pedunculate oaks occur.","This species is restricted to veteran trees, so any activities which destroy these trees (e.g. cutting down avenues) is strongly detrimental to the species. The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density. Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors. Felling of sick or dying trees - especially in the favoured, open sunny situations, where they are more vulnerable to this treatment and where more visible to people - is a threat to this species.In Hungary this species is threatened by habitat loss because of the forest management (removal of old trees) in the hills and mountains. Lowland and wood pasture populations are threatened by abandonment of the grazing activity and reforestation (the old stems are no longer exposed to the sun) (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).In Romania removal of the occupied oaks from pastures and forests is an issue; also local people use these for firewood (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009).","This species is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive.In Hungary important populations of this species live in protected areas and Natura 2000 areas. The species is legally protected in Hungary. In Germany there are several actions and plans (monitoring and management) in place according to the EU Habitats Directive. In Germany this species is listed as Critically Endangered (2009). It is also included in the Red Book of Ukraine. In Italy there are management plans in SIC.Key actions needed are to retain veteran oaks where they are in open country and to retain dying trees in situ. In denser stands of oak, opening up to improve sun penetration will favour this species.","Groh, K., Horák, J., Büche, B., Dodelin, B., Alexander, K., Schlaghamersky, J., Mason, F., Istrate, P. & Méndez, M."

The larvae develop in moist decaying wood of standing or fallen trunks, often in dead or dying parts of living trees. Pupation occurs in spring or summer in the wood near the surface.

Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing or mowing activities. Removal of ancient living or dying trees poses the major threat. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors. In its south-western range, these threats exist but only marginally affect the populations at the moment.In Hungary, habitat loss is occurring in some parts of the range as a result of removing dead wood; however this is not considered to be a major threat to the species at present (O.

Polyphagous in conifers (Pinus, Picea, Abies) and broad-leaved trees (Quercus, Fagus, Alnus, Castanea, Malus, Salix, Fraxinus, Betula, Ulmus, Corylus). The life cycle is at least three years (sometimes four). Mature larvae leave the wood and pupate in early summer in the soil in a cocoon constructed from soil and wood particles. Adults emerge in VII – VIII; they are crepuscular and nocturnal (attracted by light), and remain hidden in the daytime. In the UK it favours mature and old oaks Quercus, open-grown, in permanently damp soils, and so tends to be found through the floodplains as well as in historic parklands and wood pastures (K.N.A.

In Romania it occurs in both deciduous and coniferous forests; large populations occur in oak and hornbeam in Transylvania; males have been found on the tree trunks, and females on the soil, during the beginning of July. In the Carpathians, the beetles are active during August (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009). In Turkey larvae develop in conifers and broad-leaved trees (Schimitschek 1953); the life cycle is also three years (Canakcioglu 1993).

It develops in broad-leaved trees (especially Salix, occasionally Populus, Alnus, Acer). The larvae first develop in the thick but living wood of trunks and branches, later tunnelling between living & dead tissues; it prefers young healthy growths rather than established trees (Kaufmann 1990). The life cycle is at least three years, with pupation in spring within wood. Adults overwinter in the pupal cell and emerge in VI-IX, they fly during periods of warm sunshine although rest of time spent motionless on twigs and branches in the canopy; they are attracted to flowers for nectar and are also attracted to anything sweet, including discarded wrappers of ice lollies (K.N.A.

In Germany it lives mostly in Salix; it uses small diameter branches and trunks (less than five cm).Primarily a riverine and floodplain species; the larva is tolerant of submergence for many weeks. It lives in wet woodlands and waterside trees in the UK (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). In Hungary it lives mainly in riverine and swamp willow forests, but occurs also in deciduous forests where goat willows occurs (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). All records from Portugal are from riverine areas.","Clearance of waterside trees and wet woodland, as well as habitat loss due to logging of old willows, are threats to this species.","It is known from many protected sites (e.g. UK, Hungary, Romania).

In Hungary this species is widespread in the hilly and mountainous areas wherever extensive beech Fagus sylvatica forests occur (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Romania it is widespread in all Carpathians, where beech forests are present (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009). In Ukraine it only occurs in the Carpathians. In Italy it is recorded from most mainland regions and Sicily, absent in Sardinia (Sama 2006). Its distribution in France follows those of the beech forests, essentially (seems to be exclusively) among the mountain borders. One population is located at low altitude in the north-west (Charente-Maritime). This special population is not developing on beech as usual but uses alternative broad-leaved trees: Ulmus, Acer (B. Dodelin pers. comm. 2009). In European Turkey it has been reported from Istanbul (Acatay 1943) and Kirklareli (Oymen 1987, Malmusi and Saltini 2005). It is also found in northern Africa, Major and Minor Caucasus and Minor Asia.","In Europe this species is relatively common over much of its range. In Hungary, Slovakia and probably also in Poland the species is common or abundant in many localities where host-plants (old, sun-exposed beech trunks) are available. In Romania the size and trend of the population are stable, and the largest populations from Europe are spread in the south-western part of the country, Banat (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009). In Germany there are records from alpine beech forest: Baden-Württemberg, Bayern, and from Erzgebirge (Sachsen). Other records from other German States are presumably introductions from transported logs. Its population trend is declining. In the Czech Republic there is only one large stable population; there are many historical records but these might be introduced with fuel wood (fallen from transport and collected).There are many localities known in France but recent declines have been detected, as it is threatened by collection. The species forms small patchy populations in suitable habitats: logged places of large chablis where a big and stable population is hosted by large and old beech forests. The species is able to fly around at least at the distance of two km. Its population functioning is clearly a metapopulation model with a large and stable population as a source and small patchy sites as pits, colonised for three to ten years and then  abandoned (B. Dodelin pers. comm. 2007). In Spain its population is stable; its distribution in the north of Spain follows Fagus spp., ca 100 localities. In Italy there are 70 localities.In Greece it is abundant in Rhodope Mountains, in beech forests in central Greece (Olympus Mountains) and there are several localities. In Ukraine it is a rare species. The population size and trend have not been quantified in Turkey.","This is an obligate saproxylic species. Larvae first develop on the dead wood of exposed stumps and standing or fallen trunks (but not in contact with the ground); the larvae stay two or three years in the wood. Polyphagous in broadleaved trees (Fagus, Ulmus, Carpinus, Tilia, Castanea, Fraxinus, Juglans, Quercus, Salix, Alnus, Crataegus), although beech Fagus is the favoured tree over much of its range. The life cycle is at least two or three years, with pupation in spring or early summer in the wood. Adults emerge in VI-VIII, and are found on the host plants. The preferred habitats are large open montane beech forests or solitary trees, but also other tree species (see above) can be a habitat especially in southern Europe. In the Alps it prefers beech formations on limestone that are drier. The appropriate beech trees tend to be those that remain standing on remote slopes, where extraction is too laborious and so are not lost to firewood gathering. In Hungary this species occurs in old, extensive beech forests (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Romania it lives in old beech forests, sometimes in the south-western part of the country at low level, 200 m (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009). In Italy and Spain it lives mainly in old beech forests. In Germany it lives in beech forests in the Alps and montane areas, mainly on calcareous stands; breeding in beech and sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, but also in wych elm Ulmus glabra. In France it is found in broadleaved trees where beech is absent. In mountains, larvae are found in Fagus sylvatica, it prefers trees that are big (diameter >30 cm) and sun exposed. Freshly dead trees are colonised. Not every beech forest is suitable. The species is located only in the mature forests (managed or not) with trees of more than 40 cm of diameter. The continuity of the deadwood recruitment is essential (B. Dodelin pers. comm. 2009). There is not any detailed information on the habitats and ecology of this species for European Turkey.","A typical species depending on pastured woodland, open beech forest almost in montane areas. Long decking and late timber hauling are a major threat as the larvae have a long development phase (two or three years). Another major threat is the stacking of extracted timber on the edge of forest as this attracts beetles lying eggs. As the larval cycle is two or three years, a significant part of the population can be removed and destroyed by the subsequent removal of this timber. Stored trunks at the forest border are very attractive for Rosalia but eggs do not have any chances of survival (Duelli and Wermelinger 2005). In France the major threat is the cleaning of the logged stands and the deadwood removal. Habitat loss and fragmentation is occurring in some parts of the range as a result of forest management (O. Merkl, pers. comm. 2009).Locally the collection of specimens might pose a threat (Spain, France and Italy).","This species is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive.It is recommended that stacked timber at the forest edge is not used before four years to enable all larvae (as eggs are laid only on fresh dead wood) to finish their development cycle and enable the beetles to re-establish populations in the forest.The species occurs in several protected areas (e.g. Hungary, Romania, France). In particular some stable and important populations occurs in protected areas in the Alps (Forest Biological Reserves) and in the National Park of the Cevennes.This species is legally protected in Hungary (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Germany, in Bayern and Baden-Württemberg there is a monitoring programme in place according to the EU Habitats Directive.It is listed as Critically Endangered in the Czech Republic, Vulnerable in Germany (2009) and Least Concern in Spain (Galante and Verdú 2000).

Larvae can be found in decayed and decomposing drift wood along the strand-line of beaches (and also coastal dunes) in the Mediterranean area. The species' habitat is red (brown) and/or white rot of decaying wood (trunks and tree stumps of broad-leaved trees, especially Platanus sp., Populus sp.) lying on the sand of beaches or coastal dunes, near the sea. All the larval instars are represented in the decaying wood (J. Delnatte pers. comm. 2009). The larva is carnivorous, a predator of saproxylic beetles (such as Curculionidae, Cossoninae), and may also be saprophagous, an omnivore (in the first larval instars). Larvae move freely in the sand (Platia 1994) and so can be found away from driftwood - this does not mean that they can survive in isolation from driftwood only that they move between driftwood locations from time to time. Larvae and pupae of I. moreli have been found in the soft part of decaying wood (H. Brustel pers. comm. 2009). The larvae pupate in the spring and the adults are found in July and August under debris and at the base of plants; they are crepuscular and are attracted to lights (Leseigneur 1972, Idrissi 1982, Platia 1994, J. Delnatte pers. comm. 2009). The larvae appear also to feed on grass roots to some extent (Leseigneur1972, Platia 1994). Whether or not the species is fully saproxylic, it does seem to depend on the presence of plentiful driftwood. The driftwood also provides protection from the heat and drying aspects of sunshine. In Italy it probably lives in every sandy beach without urbanization. There is no information on the habitats and ecology of this species in Cyprus (O. Makris pers. comm. 2009).","The species is threatened by the removal of driftwood from beaches and sand dunes, as part of beach-cleaning operations and also beach-combing and firewood gathering for beach fires.","In Spain it does not occur in any protected area. It occurs at least in one place (Hyères) in a protected area in France.The key actions needed are educational, to ensure that beach-cleaning operations only focus on man-made debris and leaves all driftwood in place, including flotsam and jetsam. With so much river regulation, natural driftwood has become much scarcer and the habitat is usefully supplemented by debris from shipping, etc.Firewood gathering also needs to be limited such that all driftwood is not removed.","Livingstone, S., Dodelin, B. & Méndez, M."

Alexander pers. comm. 2009).","This is an obligate saproxylic species. The larvae develop first in and later under the dry bark of dead, sun exposed branches and stems (often of 15-30 cm diameter). The life cycle is one or two years, with pupation in spring deep in the wood or in the thick bark. Adults emerge in IV-VIII, and are found on the host plants and (rarely) at flowers. The adults hardly ever visit flowers and remain on their host tree for most of their short lives. The host is mainly aspen Populus tremula; the larva develops in recently dead wood (from twigs to branches of a large diameter) which is always quite dry. The phloem needs to be free from fungal development (Rejzek 2006). Develops in broad-leaved trees (especially Populus, also in Salix, Rosa, Quercus, Betula). In Romania adults have been observed in the evening on Crataegus flowers.In Finland it lives on aspen both in sunny and shaded habitats. In Hungary it lives in lowland poplar forests, mainly on white poplar (Populus alba), and also in the hills and mountains where aspen (Populus tremula) grows. In Germany it can live in different broad-leaved forests. UK sites included old orchards (Malus) as well as ancient forest.",There appear to be no major threats to this species at European level. It is unclear why it became Extinct in England.,In the UK this species is considered Extinct.In Hungary some of the localities are in protected areas but riverine and lowland poplar stands and slope forests should be left undisturbed.,"Nieto, A., Dodelin, B., Campanaro, A., Mannerkoski, I., Tezcan, S., Horák, J. & Méndez, M."

Adults and larvae live beneath the bark on relatively freshly dead large branches and trunks of broadleaved trees, while the bark is still firmly attached and the cambial layers still sappy (Alexander 2002).

In Hungary removal of dead wood is a threat, but this apparently has no serious impact on the species (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). The habitat is generally widespread and so the reasons for its rarity are unclear.","There is a need to maintain continuity and connectivity of the habitat. Research on the species distribution, ecological requirements and threats are required. Standard good practice recommendations under FSC, etc. are among the only conservation actions in place.

In Denmark this species is widespread in the country (Hansen 1996). In Russia it has been reported from Moscow and it is a rare species (Nikitsky et al. 1996). In Hungary , this species is very rare, only a few very old localities are known (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In the Britain it is a rare and elusive species with a very fragmented range, and with just a small number of very isolated populations; conservation status 'Nationally Scarce'; no data on population size or trends, but likely to be declining (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). In Italy there are only three records.","This is an obligate saproxylic species. Adults and larvae live beneath the bark on relatively freshly dead trunks and large branches from broad-leaved and conifer trees, while the bark is still firmly attached and the cambial layers still sappy (Alexander 2002). Sites include forest country as well as cultural landscapes, in closed woodlands, open wood pastures and historic parklands, wooded riversides, etc. Its rarity in Britain suggests requirements for very precise conditions, in contrast to the more widespread P. dermestoides; it possibly lives deeper under bark - away from fracture points, possibly needs larger items of wood, in sheltered sunny glades (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). The larvae are said to be predatory on Diptera larvae. It is most widely known from Quercus forest across its range. Adults have been reported in flight during the evening. As there are no extant populations known in Hungary, no information is available about its habitat there (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).","The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density. Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors.","The conservation status of this species in Britain is Nationally Scarce but there are no specific actions in place, despite rarity in Britain, but standard good practice recommendations under FSC, etc.; some of the known sites are in legally protected areas although land management even there is not necessarily sympathetic (K.N.A.

In Europe it occurs only in continuous sub-montane forests, living under the bark of deadwood of conifers, mainly on fir; it has also been found on spruce. The species is probably an indicator for continuous conifer forest and there is no secondary habitat. The species seems to depend on veteran trees.","Changes in tree composition, loss of primary habitats and its basic characteristics like dead wood supply and sun-exposure are major threats to this species.  Because the habitat of this species is veteran trees any activities which destroy these trees (e.g. cutting down avenues) is strongly detrimental to the species. The species has a tendency to indicate ecological continuity of forests in Europe. The causes of this species decline are not fully understood. It could be related to the decline of fir trees.","To keep continuous forest areas in the landscape and restore traditional forest management, eg wood-pasture should be promoted.

Both species are recorded from Italy, which suggests that the records are genuine.","The species is expanding in central-eastern Europe but declining in the surrounding areas. In the Czech Republic there are strong populations due to withering poplar plantations; it is the same situation in most parts of central Europe. In Germany, in the eastern part it seems common. In Hungary populations in hilly and mountainous broad-leaved forests and indigenous or planted pine forests are mostly small; populations in riverine willow galleries and indigenous or planted poplar plantations are often much stronger (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Ukraine it is considered very rare. In Spain two specimens were collected in a single locality in the 1960s and it has never been found again (Español 1963). Very rare or presumably extinct in Spain (M. Méndez pers. comm. 2009).","This is an obligate saproxylic species. Larvae and adults live under bark of deadwood of a variety of broad-leaved trees: Quercus, Acer, Populus, and rarely Pinus. The adults and larvae are saproxylophagous, feeding on the decaying wood, but are sometimes reported as necrophagous or predatory (A. Putchkov pers. comm. 2009). The species needs open spaces and prefers lowland areas with soft-wooded broad-leaves. The adults and older stages of larvae hibernate under bark on the deadwood. In Romania larvae develop under very decayed bark of aspen Populus tremula trees with the fungi Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Ceratocystis etc. The adult is active in V-VI. Young beetles appear in VII-VIII (Nikitsky et al. 1996). In Hungary it occurs in all kinds of indigenous and planted forests, including hilly and mountainous broad-leaved forests, pine, poplar and black locust tree plantations, city parks, alleys or in solitary trees along roads (O.

It is certainly Extinct in Denmark - not found in ca 100 years (National Environmental Research Institute 2007).","This is an obligate saproxylic species. The larvae develop in wood mould, typically in the base of hollow living trees, usually in the trunks, with large cavities containing wood mould, primarily derived from natural fungal decay of the dead heartwood. In most sites the larvae are found in wood mould in close contact with the soil but there is at least one observation of larvae in wood mould a few metres up in the tree. The situation of the occupied hollow trees may vary across its European range, with open-grown trees important in the cooler and damper west, but shade more important under more continental conditions. Sites may be in forest or in cultural landscapes, eg old wood pastures, old coppiced woodlands, etc. (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009).In England it occurs in three very different sites: one active old wood pasture dominated by ash Fraxinus, one abandoned old ash coppice, and a former old wood pasture dominated by beech Fagus, all part of the cultural landscape rather than old forest (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). In Hungary most records are from hollow turkey oaks Quercus cerris (not necessarily old ones) with near-ground cavities filled with wood mould, but also from lime Tilia, ash Fraxinus and maple Acer (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In France it is known only from old and ancient beech forests with trees damaged at their base; the larvae live in cavities in contact with soil in living Fagus or rarely in Quercus (Leseigneur 1972).","In England, natural loss of old trees from the known sites and lack of new generation trees are major threats to this species; also singling of old coppice stools in productive woodland. Canopy closure is a potential threat in the UK, as this cools the wood mould and slows larval development (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009).","This species is listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. This species is listed as Regionally Extinct in Denmark (2005), as Critically Endangered in the Czech Republic and is included in the British Red Data Book as Endangered (Shirt 1987). Conservation of old-growth trees, protection of known sites, and preservation of traditional coppicing are recommended for the conservationo of this species, as well as the provision of substitute habitat by creating trees with cavities. This species would benefit if traditional coppices continue to be managed, but also if forests are being left intact without removing old live trees with cavities.In the UK, all three known sites are protected under UK legislation and SAC. It has been illegal to collect this species since 1988. A Species Action Plan was developed (1996) and a Species Recovery Programme was initiated by English Nature. Tree mapping and documentation projects are available at all sites. New tree plantings have been carried out at the active wood pasture site; future host trees have been selected for retention from beech natural regeneration at the former wood pasture site. No analysis of tree population dynamics has been carried out however, so there is currently no real understanding of long-term host tree availability. Fallen hollow beech trees have had their trunks re-erected and filled with sawdust and other materials, and Limoniscus larvae and elytra have been found within them after six years of composting (Green 1995, Whitehead 1998) (K.N.A.

In Russia it is only present in the Voronezh region, in the middle part of European Russia. In Hungary it is known from very few localities in the hilly regions, mainly from the western part of the country (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009.

It is an old growth species that develops exclusively in the red-rotten heartwood of oak Quercus trunks and main boughs, in living trees as well as dead ones; the larvae thought to feed on the larvae of the beetle Mycetophagus piceus; they pupate at the end of the season and overwinter in the adult stage; the adults are active nocturnally (Alexander 2002). In Ukraine all larvae have been found in decayed stubs of Quercus. The beetle inhabits groups of very old oaks in lowlands and highlands, as well as solitary trees in alluvial woodlands (Laibner 2000). In Hungary it is known from old growth forests with very old oak trees (mainly pedunculate oak) (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).

This species is restricted to veteran trees, so any activities which destroy these trees (e.g. cutting down avenues) is strongly detrimental to the species. The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density. Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors.","Generally, the most important conservation measure to be recommended is the protection of large old oak trees, and habitat management to ensure that there is a constant or increasing supply of such trees in future.It occurs in protected areas in UK and in Hungary.

In Hungary this species is rare in a few mountainous areas, with small populations, but is not a threatened species (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Denmark it is rare and local. In France it is uncommon. In Spain there are only three localities in the north (Recalde Irurzun and San Martín Moreno 2007).","This is an obligate saproxylic species. The larvae develop in decayed wood and under bark of broad-leaved trees, especially favouring stumps; it is a predator or necrophagous. The larvae hibernate and pupate in mid May, and the adult is active in VI-VII and are attracted to lights. This species lives in broad-leaved forests and in open country. In the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic it is found in the forests of the submontane and montane zones (Laibner 2000); in Ukraine it similarly is found in mountain forests. In Hungary it occurs in the cool, shady parts of the forests, mainly in ravines and stream valleys (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). This species is considered to be a strong indicator of good ecological condition of forests.","The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density. Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors.","The species occurs in several protected areas (e.g. Hungary, Ukraine). It is considered Data Deficient in Poland.

Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In France this species is very rare and sporadic; there is one historical record (verified) before 1905 in the border between France and Italy (Mont Cenis, centre of the northern Alps); it has not been seen again at this locality but is indicated in 1960' in the Cote d'Or department in one locality (Leseigneur 1972). In Italy it occurs only in the four mainland regions and the most recent record is from 2001. In Greece it is present but scattered. In Germany it is present in the south and the populations seem to be stable. In Ukraine it is widespread but rare. In the Czech Republic, in Bohemia, it is rare and in Slovakia in South Moravia is common (Laibner 2000).","This is an obligate saproxylic species. Laibner (2000) states that the larvae develop in decayed roots and stump remnants covered with soil, but (Dolin 1988) says the larvae develop in forest soil under trees, near dead trunks and stubs in relatively humid places. Pupation takes place in the ground at the end of July-August, the adults overwinter in the pupal cells, and become active in V-VI; they are active in daylight. The adults do not fly far from the places where larvae are developing (Dolin 1988). In forest-steppe formations and open mixed south-facing forests. In Ukraine it occurs in broad-leaved forest. In Hungary this species occurs mainly in open thermophilous oak forests (mainly of turkey oak and white oak), often in ecotonal situation (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).",Wood chipping of stumps (mechanical site preparation) after clear cutting is a major threat to this species.In Hungary the species is not threatened.,Forest management adapted to the needs of this species such as leaving dead stumps in their original position to decay is recommended.It is necessary to protect some places (territory) where the beetles occur.

In Portugal it has been recorded from a single locality in the northern part (Barros 1932). In Ukraine it occur in the east area until the Dniper River; in Crimea absent. In Britain its has a very restricted range in the far south of England (Mendel and Clarke 1996).,"A not particularly common species that is declining in some range states, but overall it is not declining in Europe.In the UK it has a very fragmented distribution, with just a few isolated populations, four main centres; at least one strong population (Mendel and Clarke 1996, K.N.A.

In Hungary it is widespread in the hilly and mountainous areas; the populations are strong (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Denmark it is rare but somewhat widely distributed (National Environmental Research Institute 2007). In Sweden it is rare and localized and has declined.","This is an obligate saproxylic species. Larvae develop in relatively soft white-rotten heartwood of beech Fagus, ash Fraxinus, and elm Ulmus (and some other species, including fruit trees); in trunks, logs and boughs, and more rarely in stumps; pupate at end of season and overwinter as adult; adults have occasionally been taken off hawthorn Crataegus blossom (Alexander 2002). Larvae are typical predators which eat the larvae of other saproxylic insects: Cerambycidae (Leseigneur 1972), Lucanidae (Husler and Husler 1940, Iablokoff 943), Bostrichidae, Curculionidae and some Diptera (Dolin 1988). The adults are active in V-VI.UK sites tend to be ancient wood pastures in the cultural landscape, with open-grown trees (old growth) (Alexander 2002). It is also found on floodplains and forest-steppe formations, in preserved deciduous forests of submontane zone (Laibner 2000). In Hungary it occurs mainly in oak, hornbeam and beech forests, mainly open stands and ecotonal situations (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).","The main overall threat is likely to be degradation or loss of habitat quality, involving structural changes in the tree populations arising from changing land use – affecting age structures and tree density. Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors.","Generally, the most important conservation measure to be recommended is the protection of old trees of appropriate species, and appropriate habitat management (especially leaving dead wood rather than 'cleaning' it up).It is included in the British Red Data Book as Vulnerable (Shirt 1987); it is also a priority species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.The species occurs in several protected areas (e.g. UK, Hungary).","Mannerkoski, I., Hyvärinen, E., Alexander, K., Büche, B., Mason, F. & Pettersson, R."

ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,INSECTA,COLEOPTERA,CETONIIDAE,Gnorimus,variabilis,,,,,NT,,VU,B2ab(iii),"European regional assessment: assessed as Near Threatened because this species is entirely dependent upon veteran trees as it inhabits decaying heartwood. This is a very specific habitat type which is already highly fragmented and subject to continuing significant decline. Although this species has a relatively wide distribution, its Area of Occupancy is small as it is only found in veteran trees which are scattered across the landscape at very low densities. The Area of Occupancy of this species has not been quantified, but it may not be much greater than 2,000 km2. The rate of loss of veteran trees has not been quantified, but it is significant, and it may potentially exceed 20% in the next ten years (= three generations). Moreover, there is very little regeneration of suitable habitat across the species' range. Once the existing veteran trees have died, there will be no replacements in many areas. Even if efforts are made now to re-plant appropriate tree species, there may still be a 'gap' during which time there would be very little suitable habitat available. EU 27 regional assessment: regarded as Vulnerable (B2ab(iii)). It is only known from a very small number of locations in each EU country for which we have data (with the exception of France). Although the Extent of Occurrence is large, the Area of Occupancy is estimated to be less than 2,000 km2. A 1x1 km grid has been used to roughly estimate the Area of Occupancy, since the species occupies veteran trees which are easily identified and surveyed. With the exception of France, the whole distribution is severely fragmented, and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of suitable habitat. No rescue effect is expected as populations outside the EU are fragmented and declining too. Action is urgently needed to protect and appropriately manage existing veteran trees, as well as to ensure that suitable habitat continues to be available in future.",Unknown,"This species is distributed across the wooded and mountainous regions in Europe, from Britain to the Caucasus.

In Portugal it has been recorded only from a single mountainous area in the extreme north, not recorded for more than 80 years. In France it occurs in the centre and south, especially in mountain and hilly regions (Paulian and Baraud 1982). In Britain it is confined to small areas in the south-east.","This species is rare in Europe and has a fragmented population throughout its range. Declines are reported from a number of states.In the UK it has a very fragmented range with just two remaining isolated populations: one substantial population in Windsor Great Park and Forest and a smaller one at Parham Park in West Sussex; there is no evidence for any decline in recent years but a number of old sites have been lost in the past (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). In Denmark it is very rare and there are only few new finds. It is known from six or seven localities in the Czech Republic. In France it is considered rare (Paulian and Baraud 1982) and populations are probably stable as there are still a large number of old trees. In Italy it is rare and in Switzerland it is considered be rare and mainly restricted to the Tirol. In Germany it has gone locally Extinct in some regions; populations are declining at a slow but persistent rate; almost no large populations are known any more. In Spain it is a rare species whose rarity is probably related to the decline of forest living; it is more or less restricted to the northern fringes (Micó and Galante 2002); apparently decreasing in numbers as many of the records are old. In Ukraine it is relatively rare and in Hungary it is rare, and the populations are isolated and small (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).

The situation of the occupied hollow trees may vary across its European range, with open-grown trees important in the cooler and damper west, but shade more important under more continental conditions. (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). It tends to be restricted to very large old trees and the decay is usually caused by red-rot fungus, especially Laetiporus sulphureus.Typically found in broad-leaved trees (especially oak Quercus and chestnut Castanea) in central and northern parts of its range. In southern Europe it may also be found in conifers (Abies, Pinus). In the UK the species clearly needs old open-grown oak Quercus trees; it is not found in closed-canopy shady situations. Occupied trees are invariably in open parkland situations rather than 'forest' (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009). In Spain it is associated with oak forest, not necessarily open; also in chestnut forest. In Sweden it lives in wooded pastures with old oaks; flying adults seem to prefer the more sun-exposed canopy and become unable to take off at temperatures below 20ºC if not sun-exposed (Eliasson 2000). In France larvae develop in wood mould of tree cavities, essentially Quercus and Castanea, but sometimes (rarely) in Alnus, Fagus sylvatica and Pinus maritima (Paulian and Baraud 1982).In Ukraine adults are active in V-VII, feed at flowers of Umbelliferae and Sambucus nigra; the larvae develop in wood and stubs of oak Quercus, chestnut Castanea, willow Salix, and alder Alnus. The life cycle is one year and pupation takes place in the wood. In Hungary the species is found in mountainous broad-leaved forests where voluminous dead trunks are abundant; larvae have been found in dead wild cherry Prunus, alder Alnus and beech Fagus. It is not found in wood pastures (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Romania it has been reported from old forests where trees large big hollows with wood mould; adults can be found on the bark of host trees (P.

Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors. In the UK the loss of old trees in the historic parkland sites and canopy closure are threats to this species, as this cools the wood mould and slows larval development. In Spain, logging, forest fragmentation and the removal of dead wood from the ecosystem are factors that are having a negative impact on this species. In Hungary the species is threatened by removing dead wood and by illegal collecting that destroys the microhabitat of the larvae.","The key conservation measure needed for this species is that veteran trees are protected and appropriately managed, and that measures are taken to ensure that there will be a constant or increasing stock of veteran trees over decades to come. This applies to the whole range of the species.In the UK both known sites are protected under UK legislation.

It is considered a rare species by extreme fragmentation of the populations. During the last glaciation, P. mirifica was able to survive in a number of areas traditionally regarded as refugia in the Mediterranean region: the southern Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy, the Balkans and the Middle East (full inventory and map in Tassi et al. 2004). In Spain it is known from a few isolated locations in the Central and Betic mountain ranges (eight localities). It was discovered in France in 1975 by trapping; it is extremely localised. One forest has the biggest population known over the whole distribution area. There are six other sites in the south of France but only with few specimens found and some of these are yet to be confirmed (Tassi et al. 2004). This species also occurs in Near East.","This is a flagship species both for the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the Mediterranean zone, its rarity is related to the decline of its habitats and its current distribution is a series of relict populations, and probably previously included a range much greater in the Mediterranean region. Its situation in other countries of the western Mediterranean such as Italy and France is also bleak.The main population is in France and the population in south-eastern Europe is smaller. In Greece the species has been reported from eight localities very rich in old growth forests. In Bulgaria it has been reported from three old localities that have to be confirmed. In Albania it is present in only one locality (in Petrovac). In Bosnia it has been reported from five localities that have yet to be confirmed. It is considered that the population is decreasing.","This is an obligate saproxylic species. The larvae develop in wood mould in the base of hollow living trees, usually trunks and main boughs with large cavities containing large volumes of wood mould, primarily derived from natural fungal decay of the dead heartwood; where the type of rot has been identified it is always red-rot. Larvae normally take two years to develop, longer where conditions not optimal. Suitable trees occur in a wide variety of situations, all places where trees have been retained into maturity and old age, for a variety of reasons. Adults are active in June, July and August. It has been reported from Quercus pubescens forests and it occurs in the limestone from warm places in south-eastern Europe (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009). In Spain it is associated with oak Quercus forests. In France it lives only in Q. pubescens forest and this kind of forest is becoming very rare.","Loss of hollow trees and lack of future replacement generations is a major threat to this species. Also forest fragmentation and removal of the dead wood are  threatening the species.Logging of Quercus pubescens is a very important danger for the species. In France, in the biggest locality, trees are well protected by the natural relief (profond lapiaz) but the entomological pressure from amateur collecting is a supplementary threat (surveys are organised during the summer to destroy illegal traps installed by 'entomological tourists') (Tassi et al. 2004).",In France the principal site is classified and managed for forest preservation (Natura 2000). Important entomological inventories are being conducted in 2009 and 2010. There is an urgent need for the protection of the large forests of Quercus pubescens.

Sub-fossil material has been found in a peat-bog in Denmark where the species no longer occurs (Paulian and Baraud 1982).In eastern Europe it occurs from south Belarus, middle Russia to Ural (on east). In Ukraine it lives in forests and in the northern part of forest-steppe zones. In Hungary the species is widespread in the hilly and mountainous areas and in the lowlands where extensive forests occur. In Romania it is widespread in all regions, from lowland with grass and small forests up to the low mountains. In Italy it is present in mainland and Sicily.In Cyprus Protaetia aeruginosa does not occur; it was reported from Cyprus erroneously as a result of misidentification of Protaetia (Cetonischema) speciosa (C. Makris pers. comm. 2009). Cetonischema speciosa marchei has been described as an endemic subspecies of Cyprus (Alexis and Delpont 1999).","This species appears to be rare over much of its European range and, although the overall population trend remains unknown, it is known that it is declining in some parts while increasing in others. There is recent evidence that it is not as rare as previously thought, in some areas at least, once appropriate trapping techniques have been applied. However, hollow trees are known to be becoming increasingly scarce across Europe and so a downward trend in abundance and number of localities may be expected to be occurring.The population size and trend have not been quantified in Hungary, although the species is regarded as common in its localities. In Romania there are large populations where old forest and meadows are still present - the species needs bright oak forest (P. Istrate pers. comm. 2009). In France the the use of window traps and traps with wine placed at high level in old oaks has resulted in the recent discovery of new populations (R. Allemand pers. comm. 2009).This species is extremely rare in the Iberian Peninsula where rarity is probably related to the decline of the forests they inhabit, and the current distribution is probably a relict population of a formerly much greater range. In Greece it is currently rare and continues declining. In the Czech Republic it is rather rare and is only occurring in a few areas, but although the species is very rare, it is expanding. There is no population data for Italy. In Ukraine it is rare.","This is an obligate saproxylic species.

Suitable trees may occur in a wide variety of situations, all places where trees have been retained into maturity and old age, for a variety of reasons. The adults are active in V-IX, fly during warm days, and are very attracted by sap-runs; they usually live in the canopy of trees.In central Europe it is linked to thermophilous oak forests. In Hungary it occurs in various broad-leaved forests types where hollow trunks are abundant; especially frequent in riverine willow galleries (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Romania it occurs especially where there are a lot of old oaks with large hollows. In France this species in found only in large broad-leaved forests in plains (Paulian and Baraud 1982). In Spain it is linked to large forested areas of deciduous species in which their larvae develop. In Ukraine larvae develop in stubs and decayed wood of oak and fruit trees; in old forests and gardens, the adults are rarely found at flowers.","Removal of old trees and habitat fragmentation are major threats to this species, for example in Spain. Also the excessive use of insecticides is a local threat (Greece). In Ukraine the destruction of old trees, where larvae develop, are posing a threat to P. aeruginosa.

The adults show summer activity, VI-VIII; adults have been found feeding at sap oozing from wounds on large oaks, willows and lime trees in large forest patches.In Poland it occurs in networks of rural avenues in northern Poland; the hollow trees are generally above 200 cm in circumference, with a tendency towards higher occupancies of the larger trees, with circumferences above 300 cm; no preferences for tree species or for exposition, just hollow trees (Oleksa et al. 2006). In Spain it is associated with large forested areas of broad-leaved trees in which their larvae develop. In Ukraine the adults are often seen on trees with flowing sap (old forests and gardens) usually on glades and edges; larvae develop in old stubs and hollows of oak Quercus, willow Salix, pear-tree Pyrus, lime Tilia, and aspen Populus tremula.

This species is restricted to decaying heartwood; it is found only in large, old veteran trees of a variety of broad-leaved species (including oak Quercus, willow Salix, beech Fagus, fruit trees Malus, Prunus and Pyrus, and lime Tilia) in both relatively open old-growth woodland and traditional cultural landscapes. This species has very poor dispersal capacity (it is a weak flier), and consequently linear habitat features (e.g. avenues of ancient trees) are critically important for retaining connectivity and viable populations. The larvae develop in accumulations of wood mould in hollow living trees, usually trunks and main boughs with large cavities containing large volumes of wood mould, primarily derived from natural fungal decay of the dead heartwood. Larvae normally take two years to develop, longer where conditions not optimal. Suitable trees may occur in a wide variety of situations where trees have been retained into maturity and old age, for a variety of reasons. (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009).

The situation of the occupied hollow trees may vary across its European range, with open-grown trees important in the cooler and damper west, but with shading more important under more continental conditions. Suitable trees occur in a wide variety of situations - old wood pastures, historic parklands, hedgerow trees, old avenues, orchards, etc, all places where trees have been retained into maturity and old age, for a variety of reasons (K.N.A. Alexander pers. comm. 2009).Oak Quercus spp. is the most important tree for O. eremita, followed by lime trees Tilia spp., willows Salix spp., beech Fagus sylvatica and fruit trees Prunus spp., Pyrus spp, and Malus spp. In many regions, ash Fraxinus spp., elm Ulmus spp., chestnut Castanea sativa, aspen and poplars Populus spp., birch Betula spp. and maple Acer platanoides are also important host trees. Mulberry trees Morus spp., common alder Alnus glutinosa, plane trees Platanus spp., walnut trees Juglans regia and hornbeam Carpinus betulus are other tree species which the beetle has been found deevloping in. Reports from conifer trees are rare (Ranius et al. 2005). Basically the tree species is not important; but what is important is that the trees have survived into old age and been colonised by non-pathogenic heartwood decay fungi; networks of trees are required in order to maintain population viability, to avoid the insidious effects of fragmentation and isolation.","This species is restricted to veteran trees, so any activities which destroy these trees (e.g. cutting down avenues) is strongly detrimental to the species.

In France larvae develop in diverse broad-leaved trees (Fagus, Populus, Ulmus) but with a preference for Fagus; they use small white-rotten (probably by Polyporus squamosus) holes in living trees at two or six metres above the soil (Dodelin 2006). In Finland it is often found in aspen Populus tremula but also in other broad-leaved species.In Hungary it occurs in mountain broad-leaved forests, mainly in oak, hornbeam and beech, but also from soft-wood riverine forests in the lowlands (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In France it is found in old-growth forests with no management and also in parks in cities, in thermophilous conditions (Dodelin 2006). Sites in the UK are ancient wood pastures and historic parklands - old growth within the cultural landscape (Alexander 2002).","There are no major threats to this species at the European level. However, in some range states (e.g. UK) the species is potentially seriously threatened by clearing of dead wood in ancient parklands and wood-pastures.","In the UK, this species has conservation status, Nationally Scarce (Hyman and Parsons 1992); otherwise reliant on general FSC guidelines.

This species has been found feeding on the fruit bodies of wood-decay fungi such as Pleurotus, Polyporus, Inototus, Lentinus, Bjerkandera, Fomes. Piptophorus, and Daedaleopsis. In Ukraine, larvae develop mostly on Pleurotus, sometimes on Polyporus, Inototus, Lentinus, Bjerkandera.

Piptoporus, Daedaleopsis) mostly on broadleaved trees, but presumably just feeding in some cases, not necessarily egg-laying; flight occurs from May. The life cycle is one or two years (Nikitsky et al. 1996). In Ukraine it occurs only in the forest zone. In Hungary the known localities are in old growth forests, mainly oak and beech, where the main host fungus Pleurotus pulmonarius occurs (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009).

In Hungary this species is widespread in the hilly and mountainous areas. It is much more sporadic on the lowlands, mainly in riverine willow and oak galleries. In Romania it is widespread, especially in the hilly areas with sun exposed slopes. It also occurs in the European part of Turkey and it has been reported from Istanbul (Schimitschek 1953).In Italy it is mainly distributed in northern and central regions (for certain southward to Latium) (Bartolozzi and Maggini 2006). In Spain it is present in the northern half of the country and occupies a total of 32 provinces (Galante and Verdú 2000, López-Colón 2000). Its southernmost distribution limit is a south-western and north-eastern line running from Cáceres province to Sierra de Gredos in northern Toledo, Sierra de Guadarrama, Serranía de Cuenca, east of Teruel and north of Tarragona. To the south of this line two isolated localities are known, one of them in Albacete (Galante and Verdú 2000) and the other one in the south of Badajoz (Blanco Villero and Sáez Bolaño 2007). Within the northern half, the presence of this species in Valladolid province requires confirmation. In Portugal it occurs in the northern half, most records being from the western part (Grosso-Silva 1999, 2005), and there are also two recent (1990 and 2006) records from the centre: Sintra, north-west of Lisbon  (J.M. Grosso-Silva and P. Soares-Vieira pers. comm. 2009). In Britain it is largely confined to the south-east of England, where it is widespread.In Denmark this species is Extinct (2003).

The larvae develop in moist decaying wood near or below the soil surface, including decaying old stumps, but also in the base of fence posts; always decay from white-rot fungi; and generally in light soils; larval development takes about four years in the UK but five in European Turkey; pupation in IX; adults are active in VI-VII, feed on fruit and sap, and fly mainly in the evening (Lodos 1989, Alexander 2002). In Ukraine larvae mostly live in wood of oak Quercus, sometimes other broad-leaved trees. In European Turkey larvae develop in dead wood of Castanea, Fraxinus, Populus, Quercus, Salix, Tilia. The species needs big trunks and stumps.In Hungary this species lives in thermophilous oak woods (mainly in turkey oak woods) in the hills and the lower mountain areas. Important populations occur in wood pastures and riverine forests, where pedunculate oaks occur. Sometimes it develops in other broadleaved trees (e.g. willow) (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). Sites in the UK are mostly in the cultural landscape and especially in human settlements which tend to be richer in suitable trees, etc, than open countryside (Alexander 2002). In Spain this species is very polyphagous on broad-leaved tree species. In the north, it is present in bocage landscapes, city gardens, riparian forests and forests below 700 m. Towards the south, in Mediterranean areas, it is present at higher altitudes up to 2,000 m, in Quercus forests, including dense forests (Proyecto Ciervo Volante 1996, M. Méndez pers. obs. 2009).","The overall decrease in the average age of forests due to more intense management and exploitation is a major threat. A future threat in eastern Europe is increased forest exploitation, leading to a decline of this species. Abandonment of coppicing and pollarding will lead to forest closure and will negatively affect the species. Loss of dead wood and old trees, forest clearing and removal of living hedges are also potential threats. In Britain, suitable habitat has been disappearing from the wider countryside to such an extent that the species now has a more urban and suburban distribution pattern. The species is also popular with collectors.","This species is listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive and Appendix III of the Bern Convention.In the UK it has conservation status as Nationally Scarce (Hyman and Parsons 1992); also legal protection from trade and a few key sites are designated as SAC.

It also occurs in the Caucasus and Turkey.","This species seems to be common in eastern Europe and scarce in other European countries. In Hungary this species is widespread in the hilly and mountainous areas, much rarer in the lowlands. Population size and trend have not been quantified, although the species is regarded as not uncommon in its localities (O. Merkl pers. comm. 2009). In Romania it is common in the Carpathians. In Germany it has increased the number of records. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia it is rare. In Ukraine it is relatively a rare species; was collected in the Kharkov region. In Portugal it was first recorded from the country very recently, from the extreme north (Soares-Vieira and Grosso-Silva 2003).","This is an obligate saproxylic species. Its habitat is broad-leaved forests with veteran trees and wood-decaying fungi. It can live in small dimensions of dead wood. In Ukraine beetles have been found on carpophores of wood-decay fungi Polyporus alveolarius, Lentinus tegrinus (Drogvalenko 1997). In other places beetles inhabit fungi Lentinus betulina, Pleurotus pulmonarius, P. ostreatus (Nikitsky et al. 1996).",There appears to be no major threats to this species. Felling of old trees and destruction of decayed trunks with fungi could be a threat to this species.,"The species occurs in several protected areas (e.g. Hungary).

It is also found on old cherry trees. The extent and quality of remaining undisturbed forests with beech trees in the Carpathian region is not well known but thought to be in good condition. More research is needed on the biology and specific habitat requirements of the species and the remaining ancient beech forest. The biology of Triplax genus is not well known because they eat fruiting bodies of Pleurotus which occur sporadically and may be difficult to find, so finding the species is difficult.","Little information is available about threats to the species.

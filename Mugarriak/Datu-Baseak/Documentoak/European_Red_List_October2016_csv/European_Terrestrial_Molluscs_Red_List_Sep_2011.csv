These declines are likely to become more severe in the future, as this species has most of its range in salt-marsh/coastal dunes, within fringing habitats of a gradient of groundwater levels (often marginal strips of vegetation less than 5 m wide), and these habitats lie where sea defence construction will take place (especially in regions concerned about climate change and increased frequency of storm-surges at spring tides), and as such further declines in areas with pristine habitats might be expected, thus this species is listed as Vulnerable (VU) A2ac+3c at the European level and at the level of the 27 member States of the European Union.",Decreasing,"This is mainly a European species, but it extends through Turkey to Iran. # It ranges from southern Scandinavia to the Mediterranean and from Ireland to the Caspian Sea. # It has a scattered and often localised distribution in many countries (Cameron et al. 2003).","The population trend is thought to be decreasing. The UK has some of the biggest populations in Europe.Evidence from Ireland, where a significant 3 year survey (2008 – 2010) was undertaken on known extant sites, found 1 of the 21 sites had been totally destroyed (Moorkens and Killeen 2011). A further 7 sites had declined to a situation that the snail may already be lost or is likely to be lost in the near future (5% loss in the last 5 years, and 30% sites showing decline in the last 5 years). It should be noted that  site losses were in inland wetland habitats. The Favourable Reference Population (FRP) is ‘the population in a  given biogeographical region considered the minimum necessary to ensure  the long-term viability of the species’ (European Commission 2006). Expert opinion considers that in order to conserve the long term viability of Vertigo angustior  in the Republic of Ireland, the population Conservation Status should  be based upon maintaining the current number of sites in favourable  condition and not on number of individuals which is an unreliable  measure (see above). Thus sites that were classified as being in  unfavourable condition for population (based on assessment of snail  presence) were assessed using best expert opinion as to how much more  area of occupancy they would have if they were in favourable condition. #  As the Favourable Reference Population of the species is greater than  the Current Population, the population status is currently considered to  be unfavourable. The snail is particularly vulnerable in Europe at wetland sites, which are difficult to protect, and in coastal sites which may be subject to increasing inundation. The UK sites are currently in good condition, but the future prospects are considered to be potentially poor as the vast majority of the population is found along sea wall defences and in estuarine habitats that are becoming increasingly vulnerable to inundation. Pressure to increase sea level defences with stronger, steeper walls could destroy the populations depending on the older more vulnerable defence bunds. # # # # #Evidence from elsewhere in the range is missing in its precision due to the absence of targeted studies across the range, but proxy evidence can be taken from reporting by member states under Article 17 of the Habitat’s and Species Directive. The last round of reporting was in 2007, and member states returned assessments on range, population, habitat, future prospects and overall assessment under an assessment of either (i) favourable (green), (ii) unfavourable declining (amber) or (iii) unfavourable bad (red). The following member states have published their results as follows (2007 assessment), for the overall status of the species: Germany, France and Belgium - unfavourable bad (red), Ireland and the Netherlands - unfavourable declining (amber) and UK - Unknown.","At a broad level, it appears to be present in a very wide range of habitat categories of maritime dune grassland and maritime or inland wetland (including fen, marsh, salt marsh and flood plain), but the micro-habitat within which it is restricted means that the exact conditions which its presence demands are rare, and a lot of habitat that is “almost correct” is devoid of the snail. Where fixed dunes have the correct habitat conditions, the snail may cover a large area of occupancy. Otherwise, it can be found in an often narrow transition zone between saltmarsh and dune, and in transition zones between grassland and wetland with short herbs, mosses and Iris. In Cumbria, it occurs in moss on limestone pavement. It is normally found on permanently moist but free-draining soils, not subject to prolonged inundation. Vertigo angustior is a groundwater-dependant species.","The main threats to this species is the modification of site hydrology, heavy grazing, lack of grazing, supplementary feeding of livestock, scrub encroachment, eutrophication, pesticides, exposure to leisure activities (especially on coastal sites) e.g. caravan parks and marinas, seawall construction and modification, managed retreat of coastal marshes, fragmentation of habitat, artificial planting on open ground, motorised vehicular damage to habitats, rise of temperatures and extremes, sea level rise and flooding.","The species is redlisted in several European countries (e.g. GB, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, most federal regions of Germany) (Cameron et al. 2003). While there now are a range of protected sites where this species is present, these require ongoing appropriate site management, and this should be enough to secure the species albeit at a smaller range of sites than at present (Moorkens, pers. comm, 2011), as losses are likely to continue at inland and marginal sites especially in western Europe. In the longer term, should there be loss of present habitat from sea-level rise, then many sites would not have space for movement into new areas and some of the larger populations in Western Europe would be threatened.",This species is not used.,"Moorkens, E.

In Spain, eight subpopulations were discovered recently (Garrido #et al. 2005, Arrébola et al. 2008, Arrébola, Ruiz and Cárcaba unpublished data). Actually, the area where this species occurs in Spain is very restricted (about 0.12 km2). The only living individuals that have been identified in Europe are found in Spain. In Bulgaria and other countries, only shells have been collected although there have been intense sampling efforts. In 2010 in Turkey, Páll-Gergely (unpublished data) found a small living subpopulation.","During the last  #few years, a number of censuses and basic biology studies have been done on the three subpopulations of O. bulgarica in Spain (Andalusia). #These studies have allowed us to understand the population structure, identify periods of reproduction and growth, and to quantify them temporarily. One of the subpopulations seems to be stable in quantitative terms, having experienced a population increase during the period of the study. #This, coupled with a inferred good capacity of recolonization if the habitat conditions are maintained, suggested the possibility of a high viability of translocations. These have been done during 2009-10 and the first results are very positive (Arrébola et al. unpublished data).Three of the current subpopulations in Andalucia (Spain) have disappeared in the past ten years (approximately since 2000). All the subpopulations in the eight locations in Spain are severely fragmented. Fossil and subfossil mentions in the Iberian Peninsula have been compiled by Robles and Martinez-Ortí (2009).","The species is found in hygrophilous habitats such as small marshes; permanently moist and waterlogged soil habitats in permanent spring areas of limestone (Garrido et al. 2005, Páll-Gergely pers. comm. 2010). According to Garrido et al. (2005), bioclimatic data analysis from localities near those where O. bulgarica specimens have been found alive (Andalusia) or where fossil shells have been collected (Bulgaria, Turkey and Caucasus region) suggest this species has restricted thermoclimatic tolerances, preferring humid/sub-humid environments. Semi-arid environments would restrict the species to habitats with humidity during the summer months, as it is the case for the Andalusian subpopulations.","This species has a fragmented range in Spain that, according to our findings on its distribution and habitat, is natural and due to the situation of regression of the species to habitat refuges. #Nevertheless, human-induced degradation observed in many potential habitats-islands, mostly through the use and transformation of traditional irrigation systems, has helped to increase the degree of natural fragmentation, reducing the subpopulations to small patches without any interconnection capacity. #In any case, the separation between the locations and the lack of continuity of #favourable #habitats #cause such a severe fragmentation that it makes impossible the recolonization of an extinct location, or any kind of genetic exchange between localities #(Arrébola et al. unpublished data). On the short term, the main threats impacting O. bulgarica in Spain, that might lead to its extinction, are the habitat destruction in the known locations due to the high #human pressure existing on the use of #water and soil. On the medium and long term, the severe fragmentation #of its habitat, coupled with the potential effects of climate change, could determine a regression #even greater than the one observed currently. There is also a high risk of contamination and #drying out of the natural sources of water due to the increase of intensive farming within its potential distribution area.","The species is listed as Critically Endangered in Spain (Arrébola et al. 2008, Arrébola and Garrido 2008), whereas it is not protected in the Middle East. #Since 2005, a Conservation Plan for #O. bulgarica #within the Programme for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Land Snails of Andalusia, sponsored by the Ministry of Environment of the Junta de Andalucía and led by the Physiology and Zoology #Department (University of Seville), has been developed.

Currently, there is no evidence that the area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO) or the  number of locations are declining or extremely fluctuating.","Within its relatively large range, this species does not seem to be rare, therefore there is no reason to suppose that the number of subpopulations or the number of mature individuals are declining or extremely fluctuating.","This is a silvicol species which if found in a relatively wide habitat range. It occurs in forests or on the edge of forests where it lives on the ground among leaf-litter and decaying dead wood, or among the tallgrass vegetation along creeksides.","Deforestation and disturbance of the forests such as from recreational activities are the main threats to this species, as is residential and commercial development. However, considering the relatively large geographical range of this species, local logging or recreational activities do not affect the whole population significantly.","The species is not protected at a national level in Slovakia, Poland or Hungary. Some subpopulations are known to live within protected areas such as Zemplén TVK in Hungary. However, no conservation actions are currently required for this species.",,"Feher, Z."

More  recently, three colonies have been found in West Cork, at   Garrettstown/White Strand, Ownahinchy Strand and Inchydoney Island.  It  has also spread from its north Dublin  sites to the North Bull sands in  the city of Dublin (Byrne et al. 2009).It has been introduced into the Atlantic islands, South Africa, Somaliland, and western Australia. This snail was first noticed in North America in La Jolla, San Diego County, California, in 1914. It soon spread to several locations in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, but apparently was eradicated there by 1940. It was reported by Mead in 1971 that a second infestation in Los Angeles County occurred in 1966 which was declared eradicated in 1972. The snails were found and identified in August 1985 in San Diego, California, at several localities in about a 10 square mile area.

The species range in the UK has increased recently due to species specific survey work targeting likely areas within known regions. # The species is not known to have disappeared from any sites in the UK in the last 25 years.A three year assessment has been carried out in Ireland from 2007-2010 (Moorkens and Killeen 2011). # In the past, the number of viable populations surveyed from 1994 to 2006 was chosen as the best proxy in order to estimate population status. Following the wide-ranging survey of 2008-2010, the area of occupancy of the snail was considered to be the best proxy for measuring population condition, as (i) this area had been calculated in the detailed study, and (ii) numbers of individuals are dependent on weather conditions in the months and weeks leading up to a survey. Although it is really equating habitat occupancy with population, it is a better proxy than merely the presence or absence of living V. angustior in a population.  The Favourable Reference Population (FRP) is ‘the population in a given biogeographical region considered the minimum necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the species’ (European Commission 2006).   Expert opinion considers that in order to conserve the long term viability of Vertigo geyeri in the Republic of Ireland, the population Conservation Status should be based upon maintaining the current number of sites in favourable condition and not on number of individuals which is an unreliable measure (see above). Thus sites that were classified as being in unfavourable condition for population (based on assessment of snail presence) were assessed using best expert opinion as to how much more area of occupancy they would have if they were in favourable condition. # As the Favourable Reference Population of the species is greater than the Current Population, the population status is currently considered to be unfavourable. This is likely to be the case in other countries, but similar studies have not been undertaken as yet.  #","Vertigo geyeri is stringent in its requirement of saturated water conditions in calcareous, ground water fed flushes that are often limited in size to a few metres square. Their habitats often occur in mosaics of suitable patches within wider fen macrohabitats, that in Ireland can themselves fall within habitats that be as diverse as raised bog laggs, transition mires, lake shores, hill or mountain slopes, and wetlands associated with coastal dunes and machair (Moorkens 2003). Within these macrohabitats, however, the snail is consistent in where it lives, within the saturated and decaying roots of small calcareous sedges (particularly Carex viridula ssp. brachyrrhyncha), associated fen mosses (particularly Drepanocladus revolvens and Campyllium stellatum). It lives in sedges (e.g. Carex viridula, Schoenus nigricans) and mosses (e.g. Drapanocladus, Palustriella)  at the interface between the water table and the base of the herb layer  where the surface substrates are at or near field capacity but not  subject to seasonal flooding (Cameron et al. 2003). # The greatest indicator of optimum V. geyeri habitat is the presence of a tufa-forming spring.These habitats are all restricted in size and vulnerable to disturbance and drainage activities. Vertigo geyeri is a groundwater-dependant species.","The main threats to this species is the modification of site hydrology, heavy grazing, lack of grazing, supplementary feeding of livestock, species composition change (succession and scrub encroachment), peat extraction, eutrophication, pesticides, modification for wind energy production, fragmentation of habitat, artificial planting on open ground, motorised vehicular damage to habitats, and rise of temperatures and extremes, including flooding.","While there now are a range of protected sites where this species is present, these require ongoing appropriate site management, and this should be enough to secure the species albeit in small and fragmented sites. The species will remain conservation dependant in areas that require active management to prevent succession. Conservation is hampered by a lack of information on the wider hydrogeological regimes of the catchments feeding the springs and seepages where the snail resides. Where water abstraction for the catchment aquifer occurs, due consideration should be given to these wetland systems. In the future, the more remote sites are likely to be more sustainable than those with greater urban and agricultural needs for water, if pressure on water resources continues to increase.

In the long term, unless these sites are large, they may not ultimately be sustainable.

The winter is soft with a little snow and relatively high temperatures. The animals are found mostly among microhabitats of psammophytic and halophylic grass vegetation. #During the inactive periods in the summer (at time of a long dry, high temperatures in the day, low aerial humidity) and in the winter, the animals aggregate at the base of stems and under leaves of plants (Irikov 2008). The leaves with a rosette-form are peculiar umbrellas, ensuring more optimal microclimatic conditions. The psammophytic plant absorbs minimum amounts of dampness even, creating around the succulent and deeply situated in the sand roots a zone with a higher moisture. The sand in the base of the stem remains moist even in prolonged summer dryness and heat. The animals are #concentrated to the base of stems or are buried around the root sometimes at a long depth.

According to Elejalde et al. (2005, 2008) #the subpopulation of #Sierra de Gador is the only native population, #having originated the others by recent anthropogenic introductions (due to its gastronomic use) carried out from this only autochthonous population. #There are slight conchological differences between Sierra Gádor shells and others, specially in relation with the greater size of # the original subpopulation shells. The data in this assessment (such as the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO)) refer to the original and only subpopulation in Sierra de Gador, where the EOO would be continuous and have the same surface as the AOO, if there was no anthropic habitat destruction and fragmentation. The other subespecies #I.g. mariae and I.g. ornatissimus are restricted to Los Alcores de Punta Entinas (type locality) and Barranco Fuerte in Huecija (type locality) and surroundings (Ruiz et al. 2006).","The first census for this species has been done in Sierra de Gádor (unpublished data) and the results were not very optimistic: I.g. gualtieranus could be under the minimum density threshold for population viability, so that the density of adults would not be enough for positives or nulls growth rates #(Arrebola and Ruiz 2008; unpublished data). As there are no previous census data, it is not possible to estimate the rate of the population decline. However, indirect evidences support the hypothesis of a population decline (loss of habitats, harvest increase, fires, motorways construction, etc.). Back in 1979, Cobos already indicated that this population was declining and now, the subspecies in Almeria is already commercially extinct. Another census has been done in Sierra Elvira (Moreno-Rueda and Pizarro 2007).","Iberus gualtieranus gualtieranus is a #calcicolous, drought tolerant and thermophilic #species #living in limestone mountain areas of rocky substrate and sun exposure #sub-desert #environments with sparse vegetation. It can also occur in areas with more vegetation cover in Sierra Elvira (Moreno-Rueda 2002). It avoids earthy and shady places. #During dry weather, it takes refuge inside the crevices of the rocks and under stones. #Studies on its biology (unpublished data) indicated a low reproductive success, dispersal and predation rates, high rates of #adult resistance, synchronization of the activity, absence of predators and/or good defence against them and juvenile mortality due to adverse environmental conditions. #With its #flattened shell is well adapted to living in strict climates of drought and insulation for long periods, allowing it to penetrate deeper into the fissures of the rock and displace #I. #alonensis sensu lato in the native range of I. #g. #gualtieranus. #The subpopulations of the species living in areas of low rainfall, have developed a fast and accurate behavioural response to the rare rainy moments of the year. #Aestivation is the time of year when more juveniles die because of high temperatures that produce animal dehydration.The active periods of feeding, movement, growth and reproduction are mainly occurring during two times of the year: spring and specially in #autumn. #During #cold and dry winters, its activity is reduced (unpublished data).","Highway construction has meant that 8.7% of the #area of occupancy #is divided into 14 fragments physically separated by insurmountable barriers for snails. Three important fires have happened in the area of occupancy since 2003 (affecting 9,5% of the extent of occurrence) producing a comparatively lower density of individuals at present. Irreversible loss of the area of occupancy occurred between 1991 and 1999 (3.4 km2) due to urban and agriculture #development #(2.43% of the total EOO in 1991). #Habitat loss reaches 8.7% of the EOO from 1956 (no agriculture or urban pressure) and 2004. From a biologic point of view, poor recruitment and population reproduction and regeneration index, high juvenile mortality and low density are also impacting the species survival. #Analysis of fronts of hybridization between the subpopulations of I. #g. #gualtieranus #and other Iberus species indicate that they are in a dynamic equilibrium, and no evidence has been found that these fronts are a threat to the conservation of the subspecies. Traditional harvesting has produced a strong impact on population intrinsic factors (low rates of recruitment, reproduction and regeneration population, aggravated by high juvenile mortality) and the current density may have reached a point where the population viability would be naturally #compromised #(unpublished data). #The indiscriminate and uncontrolled collection made in recent decades derives from its great gastronomic appreciation, and even though it has been considered commercially extinct, it is still collected due to its high market value. #Furthermore, the catches are made in times of activity, when most individuals are visible to collectors, causing an irreversible impact on the population (unpublished data).","Since the low population density is the most pressing problem, it is necessary to manage/stop the catch and reinforce the population with individuals reared in captivity. The species should be included in the National and Regional Endangered Species Catalogue, which would legally prohibit its harvest. #Because of its popularity in Andalusia and its great appeal in the world of amateur malacology would be possible to use. #Since 2005, a Conservation Plan for Iberus g. #gualtieranus is developed within the Programme for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Land Snails of Andalusia, sponsored by the Ministry of Environment of the Junta de Andalucía and led by the Physiology and Zoology #Department (University of Seville). #At present, breeding in captivity (laboratory scale in Seville University) has been obtained to complete cycle (Arrébola, Ruiz, and Cárcaba, unpublished data). #In this sense, it is crucial to begin the half-scale breeding of the species (this will be done in 2011).","Irrational and uncontrolled catches of I.g. gualtieranus are going on a long-standing and a traditional way. This has led to the practically commercial extinction of this snail known as ""chapa"", but the same has not happened with captures. #Due to the natural scarcity of product, sales prices have increased dramatically and the snail is actually sold for human consumption per unit (not per kilo), reaching a price of 1-1.5 euros each specimens.","Arrébola, J."

I. alonensis has recently been proposed as a VU species in the region of Castilla La Mancha by Bragado, Araujo   Aparicio #(2009). #In our opinion, it would be necessary and urgent to manage this species like the natural and economic resource that it represents: to establish appropriate periods and catch sizes, to investigate the still unknown aspects of the species and its population, to monitor the processes and to promote the heliciculture... #Several attempts of # I. #alonensis # heliciculture are known in Spain, even though rather old and rudimentary techniques are employed.

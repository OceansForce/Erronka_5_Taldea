It looks rather like Chapman's Blue (P. thersites). It can be found on most types of grassy vegetation, ranging from quite dry, nutrient-poor grassland to moderately damp meadows. The female lays its eggs on a variety of leguminous plants, including Common Birdsfoot–trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The caterpillars feed on the leaves. They are attended by ants of the genera Lasius, Formica, Myrmica, Tapinoma and Plagiolepis. When half-grown, the caterpillars may hibernate in the litter layer. In hot climates, aestivation also takes place, in the egg or larval stage. The caterpillars pupate in the litter layer. Depending on the geographical position and altitude of the breeding ground, the Common Blue has one to three (or occasionally even more) generations a year.

It had probably been imported on Pelargonium cultivars, the ordinary or garden geraniums. From there out, because of the large popularity of these plants, it was imported and colonized large parts of Spain and France, using the Pelargonium cultivars as foodplant. The caterpillars mostly eat the flowers and buds of Pelargonium, but also the rest of the plants, including the inside of the main stem, where they are safe from insecticides. Finally, the plants collapse. The expansion can be expected to continue. In South Africa, the Geranium Bronze uses wild Geranium species as foodplant, making it possible that this butterfly will establish itself in the wild in warm parts of Europe. However, in cooler areas, it cannot settle permanently, because it has no diapause and could not survive the winter. Numerous generations a year, depending on the temperature.

This may be in moderately dry woodland, or in a hedgerow, or on a woodbank, but it also occurs on solitary groups of Blackthorn bushes. Places with brambles are favourable, providing the nectar the butterflies need. The eggs are laid on Blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), but sometimes other Prunus species are used. The female chooses twigs that will flower the next spring. The small caterpillars that develop, pass the winter in the eggshell. When they emerge, they feed on the buds and flowers. When the caterpillars are fully-grown, they pupate. The black and white pupa, suspended in a silken girdle from a twig, looks very like a bird dropping, an attempt to avoid predation.

Although very similar, these golden skippers can be distinguished by the colour of the underside of their antennal clubs. That of the Essex Skipper is black and that of the Small Skipper varies from brown to yellow. Because these butterflies need quite a lot of nectar, they can often be seen drinking on thistles, knapweeds and other purple or pink flowers rich in nectar.

Betony (S. officinalis) is often used, but also Hedge Woundwort (S. sylvatica), Alpine Woundwort (S. alpina) and Marsh Woundwort (S. palustris). The young caterpillar lives in a curled-up leaf.

Therefore, this species is considered as Near Threatened. It should however be noted that both the distribution and population size of this species in Central Europe have declined severely during the 20th century (so before the last ten years).",Decreasing,"This is a species that occurs from the southwest to southeast of Europe: on the Iberian Peninsula, in the southwest and south of France, Italy, south of Switzerland, Austria and all over the Balkans. It also occurs locally in Poland and Lithuania. There are a few scattered and isolated populations in the Netherlands and Germany. Sea level-1,500 m. It is also found in Morocco, Asia Minor, the Caucasus and Transcaucasia. The largest part of the global distribution area of the species is situated in Europe, but the species also occurs in other continents.","This is a local species, restricted to (semi-) natural areas in the northern part of its range. In the south, it is widespread. It is reported extinct in Belgium and Czech Republic. Strong decline in distribution or population size of more than 30% have been reported from Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Romania, Slovenia, The Netherlands and Turkey (European part). Decline in distribution or population size of 6-30% have been reported from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Switzerland (data provided by the national partners of Butterfly Conservation Europe).","Especially in the northern part of its range, the Tree Grayling is a typical inhabitant of the open steppe. It occurs in very warm, dry and nutrient-poor areas with much open ground and sparse vegetation, such as on rockmasses and at the edge of blown sands. The size and markings of this butterfly are very variable. While remaining on the ground, the female deposits her eggs one by one on withered blades of grass. Grey Hair-grass (Corynephorus canescens), Sheep's-fescue (Festuca ovina), Brown Bent-grass (Agrostis vinealis), bromes (Bromus spp.), Feather grass (Stipa pinnata) and other grasses are used as foodplants. The small caterpillar passes the winter in a grass tussock and, if it does not freeze, remains active during the winter. However, growth only begins after hibernation. As development is very slow, the caterpillar only pupates towards the end of the summer in August. The flight period of the Tree Grayling, that only has one generation a year, is therefore very late. Habitats: dry siliceous grasslands (21%), dry calcareous grasslands and steppes (17%), coniferous woodland (9%), broad-leaved deciduous forests (9%), heath and scrub (7%), inland cliffs and exposed rocks (7%), inland sand-dunes (5%).","This species is threatened by changes in the management of semi-natural grasslands and (in West and Central Europe) open sand dunes and heathlands. Here also nitrogen deposition leads to a faster succession of open sand areas, thus reducing the area of suitable habitat substantially. In some Central European countries the abandonment of former military training areas also leads to the invasion of shrubs and trees, further reducing the habitat.","In Lithuania and the Netherlands, the species only occurs in protected areas. In countries where the species is declining, (especially Western and Centreal Europe) important habitats should be protected and managed. More research is needed to the ecology of this species, here again, especially in Western and Central Europe.

It is an impressive butterfly and the woods it inhabits are areas of natural beauty. They are found in mixed woodlands with damp clearings, where its foodplants Aspen (Populus tremula) and Black Poplar (Populus nigra) grow. The female deposits its eggs one by one on leaves that are preferably situated in the sun, with more branches above them. The caterpillar feeds on the leaves, damaging them in a characteristic way. Starting at the point, they eat the softer tissue, leaving the middle nerve untouched. This nerve is supplied with a spun thread, which catches the caterpillar’s frass. When about two-thirds of the leaf is left, the caterpillar uses it to build a hibernaculum, which is fastened tightly onto a twig with spun thread.

It also resembles the Large Tortoiseshell, but the white patches near the tips of the forewing and on the front edge of the hindwing distinguish it from both these butterfly species. It occurs in the lowlands of Eastern Europe, in deciduous or mixed woods. It prefers damp woods and is found in clearings or at the wood edge. It is a mobile butterfly and a strong migrant.

It prefers open landscapes with few trees or bushes. Eggs are laid singly on many species of Leguminosae. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and overwinters as half-grown caterpillar. It pupates, suspended in a girdle from a stalk on the foodplant. The Pale Clouded Yellow has two or three generations a year, depending on geographical location and altitude of the flight area.
